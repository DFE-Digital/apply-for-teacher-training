As soon as you have agreed the ISLP it will be sent to your Disability Coordinator and then, with your agreement, passed on to the relevant academic and support staff.\r\n\r\nAll trainees are encouraged to disclose any specific learning need that they experience, in order to make any adjustments, both at LJMU and within our Partner Schools. As part of the enrolment process to Teacher Training Programmes all students are required to complete a Health Questionnaire and some may be asked to attend a screening appointment with our Occupational Health Unit.

Rated as ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted, we have been for some years now not only at the top of the performance tables in Somerset but in the top 5% of schools nationally for academic achievements.\r\nWe believe in the absolute moral responsibility we have for equipping students with the best possible exam results; we know that this opens doors for students and equips them with outstanding attitudes and a strong moral foundation. Equally important is nurturing every student’s potential beyond the curriculum through the huge range of enrichment available and we aim that every child participates in enrichment activities. \r\nThe Castle School was designated a National Support School, a Teaching School and the Executive Head an NLE. We work with a number of outstanding schools in the South-West as well as being a member of Somerset Challenge and networking with other schools, both supporting schools in challenging circumstances and working with other outstanding schools, is vital so that we always stay fresh and ahead of the curve. The relationships we have forged with schools in the locality has afforded us the opportunity to offer professional development and training opportunities to support the career development of trainee new and experience teachers.\r\n",

        "train_with_us": "As a school based provider of initial teacher training, the CTSN SCITT is very much grounded in the life of its local schools. All the tutors on the course are expert, practising teachers, and from the beginning of the course, trainees will spend four days a week (Monday – Thursday) in school, and attend Core Training on Fridays, either in Cambridge or Bury St Edmunds. Whilst in school, trainees will have some teaching, which will increase throughout the year, but also have plenty of time to get involved in other training activities: observing experienced teachers; working with students in smaller groups, or in one-to-one tutoring; time for assessment & planning; reading, writing & research into effective learning and teaching. Every trainee will have a dedicated subject specialist mentor, with whom training is planned and evaluated at weekly mentor meetings; these meetings are the hub of the school based training. Most of the Core Training on Fridays will look at issues in learning & teaching common to all trainees, but there are also regular (approx. monthly) subject afternoons to look at more subject specific pedagogy. In addition, each trainee will be assigned to one of the senior tutor team to oversee all aspects of the ITT year. The senior tutor team act as personal tutors throughout the course. This course leads to the awards of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) plus PGCE (subject to validation). Further details are on the CTSN website (https://ctsnscitt.info)",

        "train_with_disability": "We believe a person is only disabled when confronted by adverse attitudes and environmental barriers, and we aim to provide a positive, supportive and inclusive learning environment. Adults with disabilities are under-represented in the teaching profession and we welcome applications from everyone with a passion and commitment to becoming a teacher.\r\n\r\nWe see training teachers with additional needs as an opportunity to provide role models to our own pupils. Our programme is hosted by schools teaching pupils with a range of physical, medical, sensory and cognitive special educational needs and disabilities.\r\n\r\nAll teacher training providers have a responsibility to ensure equality of access, whilst at the same time ensuring that trainees have the health and physical capacity to teach and will not put children and young people at risk of harm, and a condition of acceptance onto the course will therefore be to satisfy the requirements for Fitness to Teach. Applicants will need to be able to travel independently to the university campus in Edgbaston and to the training schools.\r\n\r\nEvery individual will have different circumstances and needs, and for this reason we welcome confidential discussion of any special arrangements you may need for interview or subsequent school placement.\r\nEach of our partner schools will be able to provide specific accessibility information for their sites. Information about disability access for postgraduate students at the University of Birmingham can be found  [here](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/students/support/disability/index.aspx)",

As a conglomerate of schools, we have considerable experience training teachers and both recognise and value the contribution these practitioners make to our respective communities.  We offer School Direct salaried and unsalaried teacher training routes across the full range of curriculum subjects. The training programme is structured to allow trainees to develop the skills required by teachers to teach the subject that they are training in and to develop specific expertise for making a distinctive contribution in their settings.  A Subject and Teacher Mentor directs the development of subject knowledge for teaching in school settings. All schools within the TSA employ a Professional Mentor to oversee and quality assure the provision of training within the school. The programme enables trainees to have a clear understanding of learning theories and child development and how this impacts on student learning and informs their own development as a teacher. Trainees will have the opportunity to spend time in at least one of the other partnership schools to ensure a contrasting and comprehensive experience. As well as first class mentoring in school, trainees will participate in full-day conferences and shared professional studies sessions. These sessions can be tailored to the strengths and development needs of each individual.  Feedback from trainees is extremely positive with all trainees securing Newly Qualified Teaching roles for the following academic year.",

        "train_with_us": "We believe that the School Direct programme run by Chester Diocesan Academies Trust (CDAT) provides a high-quality and distinctive route to becoming a primary school teacher. Over the course of a school year, trainees spend a significant amount of time in school, learning from excellent current practitioners. This time in school is supplemented with a comprehensive training programme, again delivered by successful serving practitioners. At the end of the programme, trainees leave with both QTS and a PGCE.\r\n\r\nCDAT is a successful, growing multi-academy trust stretching across the Diocese of Chester. Our schools provide varied training opportunities – from larger schools with 350+ pupils to smaller ones with fewer than 50, and from diverse, urban areas to village and rural locations. It is this great variety that gives CDAT’s School Direct programme a special flavour. While all of the schools in the trust itself are Church of England schools – another distinctive feature of our programme – CDAT works more broadly with other faith and community schools.\r\n\r\nWe promise to provide:\r\n•\tPlacements in schools that offer strong mentoring and support.\r\n•\tHigh quality training delivered by expert current classroom practitioners.\r\n•\tQuality Masters-level input from our university partner.\r\n•\tTop quality support from experienced tutors and the programme team.\r\n\r\nMersey Boroughs ITT Partnership are CDAT’s partner provider and the awarding body for QTS at the end of the programme. Mersey Boroughs is a well-established and respected School Centred provider of Initial Teacher Training (SCITT) rated as ‘good’ by Ofsted.\r\n",
