The group of schools, known as the Abbey MAT Primary Alliance, is made up of Hawksworth CE Primary School, Manston St James CE Primary, St.Chad’s CE Primary, , St.Peter’s CE Junior,Infant & Early Years School and Holy Trinity Rothwell CE Primary.\r\nThe Abbey MAT Primary Alliance has the great strength of diversity in its makeup. The five primary schools are different in size, cultural background and socio-economic profile providing our trainee students with a varied and valuable training experience. By training in schools with such contrasting intakes of children your professional development will be accelerated, improving and widening your professional options as a teacher. \r\nThe collective resources of the Abbey MAT Primary Alliance are used to benefit the trainees. Schools with an area of outstanding practice lead enhancement training days; during the day all the trainees in the alliance meet together at one of the schools for school based training involving children and the school staff.\r\nAll of the schools have experienced and committed school mentors to support the professional training of School Direct trainees who are seen as part of the school team. The ethos of the alliance is one of mutual support and development with a very positive approach to teacher training; we believe we can work in partnership to educate, nurture and empower.\r\n\r\n",

This will identify if there are adjustments required. As a training provider, CTSN will make such adjustments in our training. We encourage all trainees to disclose all relevant information with their placement schools as this will enable them to make suitable provision.

The best time to contact the Disability Advice Team is before you start your course. By contacting the team before you begin and disclosing your disability, you'll be able to receive support from when you arrive. Email: disability@ljmu.ac.uk Tel: 0151 231 3164/3165.\r\nIf you need an Individual Student Learning Plan (ISLP) which sets out the support you may need and who is responsible for ensuring support is in place, this will be put in place by an LJMU Disability Adviser following discussion of your needs. Once finalised, your plan will be sent to you via email. As soon as you have agreed the ISLP it will be sent to your Disability Coordinator and then, with your agreement, passed on to the relevant academic and support staff.\r\nAll trainees are encouraged to disclose any specific learning need that they experience, in order to make any adjustments, both at Archbishop Blanch, our Partner Schools and LJMU. As part of the enrolment process to Teacher Training Programmes all students are required to complete a Health Questionnaire and some may be asked to attend a screening appointment with our Occupational Health Unit. This is designed to ensure that arrangements are in place, from the outset, to support any students who may need additional support or reasonable adjustments to be made. \r\nFor information on school facilities contact us at schooldirect@blanch.org.uk",

A conversation with you, by telephone or at one of our taster days, may help us clarify how we can best support you. For dyslexic trainees we would be able to offer extended deadlines for written assignments if necessary. For any other disabilities we would of course endeavour to make all reasonable adjustments to enable a successful training year. This would be done on an individual basis and has been our approach as we have trained teachers at Balcarras. For previous trainees this has included ensuring that all of their lessons are downstairs where they were not able to access the upper floor via a lift. Liaison between  Balcarras school and the GITEP leadership is very strong and we are used to making reasonable adjustments to help trainees, both short term and over the whole course.\r\nAll GITEP PGCE trainees are registered as students with the University of Bristol and this gives access to the full range of student services offered by the University. This includes support with academic assignments for trainees with dyslexia and all the University counselling and student support services. Trainees with disabilities and other needs are strongly encouraged to register with the University Library Support service.\r\n",
        "train_with_us": "Balcarras is an outstanding 11-18 mixed comprehensive school on the out skirts of Cheltenham. We pride ourselves that this is a school where every individual is valued and feels safe, where all students are inspired not only to do their best but to expand their horizons, and where everyone involved in school life feels a great sense of pride and enjoyment at being part of this community. We are a Teaching School which enables an exciting and vibrant commitment to continued professional development and an emphasis on the importance of good teacher training. We are also a maths hub school and run the GLOW Maths Hub. Three of the GITEP subject leaders are teachers at the school in maths, history and PE. We have been working as a School Direct provider since 2012, where we were one of the pilot schools for the School Direct programme. We have successfully enabled training of 30 teachers across a range of subjects.\r\nYou will be able to choose between a QTS only  and a PGCE qualification. The GITEP PGCE is awarded by the University of Bristol.",
