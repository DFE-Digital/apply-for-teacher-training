If you are unsure whether you have access needs which are covered by disability legislation, please contact Student Advice – we will be happy to offer advice and guidance.\r\n\r\nAdjustments, where necessary, become part of daily inclusive practice in school.

This delivery takes place at The Deepings and the PGCE comes with 60 Masters Credits. \r\n\r\nWe are a small local provider; with 20-25 trainees in each phase every year, we very much value our 'family ethos.'  We always aim for exceptional results in terms of the quality of the training and the career prospects of our trainees.

The Lead School for the Partnership is Twynham School, located in the historic harbour town of Christchurch, an OFSTED  'Outstanding' school and national Teaching School.  The Partnership offers a full-time one-year course running from September-July. Successful completion of this course brings with it the award of QTS (Qualified Teacher Status) with a PGCE (Post-Graduate Certificate in Education) validated by the University of Winchester \r\n\r\nA distinctive feature of the BPD course is the focus on carefully staged and appropriately supervised practical classroom experience within two secondary schools, which is further supported by academic and professional study via central training. All partner schools have experience of Initial Teacher Training and a good record of pupil progress and achievement. \r\n\r\nCurrently the BPD Partnership offers SCITT training in the following subject areas: English, Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, MFL, Design & Technology, Geography, History, Computer Science, Music, Physical Education, Art & Design, Religious Education, Business Studies, Drama & Dance/Performance. \r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a training course which is grounded in practical classroom experience then the school-centred route is ideal for you.\r\nOur trainees have a very high success rate in completion and moving onto employment,  with the majority of those gaining employment working in the local area where many gain rapid promotion.\r\n\r\n",

As a trainee, you will be working with a highly skilled, but also caring and supportive team within a school who will do everything they can for you to succeed. You will be allocated an experienced school-based mentor who will support you during the programme. In addition, there will be opportunities to participate fully in the wider aspects of school life. A hallmark of the success of our trainees is their ability to work collegiately by sharing experiences and offering mutual support.\r\n\r\nOur partner schools across the Bournville alliance reflect the diverse nature of education in Birmingham, ensuring your placements are varied and increase your chances of finding the school that is right for you.\r\n",
