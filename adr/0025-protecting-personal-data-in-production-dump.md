# 25. Redacting personal data fields for local database copies

Date: 2024-11-18

## Status

Agreed

## Context

It is occasionally useful to have access to production-like data for all kinds of analysis and experiments, such as running large or dangerous migrations, analysing queries etc.

This usually becomes more apparent during an incident and thatâ€™s where this idea originates.

The first hurdle for us to overcome is deciding what we need to redact/sanitise/pseudonymise.

## Decision

### Primary / Foreign keys
These should be left alone.

### The following tables will be empty in the data dump
- active_storage_attachments
- active_storage_blobs
- active_storage_variant_records
- audits
- blazer_audits
- blazer_checks
- blazer_dashboard_queries
- blazer_dashboards
- blazer_queries
- email_clicks
- emails

### The following fields will by anonymised

| Table name          | fields                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Consequences

This is enabling work for eventually allowing developers to use production-like data in local development.
