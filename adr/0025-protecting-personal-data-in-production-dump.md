# 25. Redacting personal data fields for local database copies

Date: 2024-11-27

## Status

Agreed

## Context

### 2024-11-27
This revision
- adds `find_feedback` and `vendor_api_response` to the tables to be deleted. The `api_response` particularly would have had all application data, including those fields we are anonymising elsewhere.
- Removes `equality_and_diversity` (jsonb) from the columns to be anonymised. The reason is that there is a lot of logic in the form and HESA conversion related to this and without realistic input, it will be meaningless for debugging issues.

### 2024-11-18
It is occasionally useful to have access to production-like data for all kinds of analysis and experiments, such as running large or dangerous migrations, analysing queries etc.

This usually becomes more apparent during an incident and thatâ€™s where this idea originates.

The first hurdle for us to overcome is deciding what we need to redact/sanitise/pseudonymise.

## Decision

### Primary / Foreign keys
These should be left alone.

### The following tables will be empty in the data dump
- audits
- blazer_audits
- blazer_checks
- blazer_dashboard_queries
- blazer_dashboards
- blazer_queries
- email_clicks
- emails
- find_feedback
- vendor_api_requests

### The following fields will by anonymised

## Consequences

This is enabling work for eventually allowing developers to use production-like data in local development.
