# PaaS / CloudFoundary cheatsheet

If you don't have access to PaaS yet see [Developer on-boarding](/docs/developer-onboarding.md).

## Authentication

To login, SSO is recommended, enter the following command and follow
the instructions:
```
cf login -a https://api.london.cloud.service.gov.uk --sso
```

After authenticating you'll be prompted to pick a space:
```
Targeted org dfe-teacher-services

Select a space:
1. bat-qa
2. bat-staging
3. bat-prod

Space (enter to skip):
```

## Spaces
You can view available spaces and switch at any time:
```
$ cf spaces
Getting spaces in org dfe as bob.developer@digital.education.gov.uk...

name
bat-prod
bat-qa
bat-staging

$ cf target -s bat-staging
API endpoint:   https://api.london.cloud.service.gov.uk
API version:    3.99.0
user:           bob.developer@digital.education.gov.uk
org:            dfe
space:          bat-staging
```

## Accessing a production console

Check you are a space developer by running `cf space-users dfe bat-prod`

If you are not but you are a space manager, you can assign yourself to the role by running: `cf set-space-role {{email_address}} dfe bat-prod spacedeveloper`

If you are not a space developer, ask to be added in the `#twd_apply_tech` slack channel

## Applications
To see the list of applications or backing services for the current
space:
```
$ cf apps

$ cf services
```
You can drill down to get a bit more detail about a particular
application using the application names given:
```
$ cf app <APP_NAME>
```

## Logs
To tail logs for a given application use:
```
$ cf logs <APP_NAME>
```

If you want to see back a little further back into the logs:
```
$ cf logs <APP_NAME> --recent
```

## Shelling into a container
To shell into a container:
```
$ cf ssh <APP_NAME>-clock
```

Then you can run a rails console as follows:
```
$ cd /app
$ /usr/local/bin/bundle exec rails console
```

A shortcut for a rails console is:
```
$ make prod|staging|qa|sandbox shell
```

(See the `Makefile` in the root directory)

You can get a list of `cf` commands and help on individual commands. e.g.:
```
$ cf --help

$ cf spaces --help
```
