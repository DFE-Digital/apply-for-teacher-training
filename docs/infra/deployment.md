# How to: deploy Apply

The apply build and release process is split into two separate GitHub Actions pipelines.

- [Build](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/apply-for-teacher-training/actions/workflows/build.yml): This is the main CI pipeline which will automatically trigger a build from a commit to the `main` branch, this pipeline is also run on the merged PR head commit when a pull request is raised targetting `main`. If run from `main` branch this also triggers the deployment pipeline after all tests have succeeded.

- [Deploy](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/apply-for-teacher-training/actions/workflows/deploy.yml): This is the main release pipeline that is used to deploy to all environments.
    - Pull Requests that have the `deploy` label applied will trigger the deployment of a short lived Review App to its own self contained environment.  This provides an opportunity to manually review the changes prior to merging them to `main`, once the PR has been merged the Review App and its environment will be deleted.
    - Continuous Deployment is enabled so a successful build on `main` triggers deployments to all environments including `production`.
    - Deployments can be triggered manually and the target environments can be chosen prior to deployment, see the [Manual Deployment guide](manual-deployment.md) for instructions.

The [Apply Ops Dashboard](https://apply-ops-dashboard.azurewebsites.net) provides an overview of what is currently deployed in each environment.

You also have to make sure that youâ€™re only merging changes that are safe to deploy. Changes that are not yet ready for production should be behind a feature flag.
