# Debugging

We do not use the Rails asset pipeline. We use the Rails webpack wrapper
[Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker) to compile our CSS, images, fonts
and JavaScript.

## Debugging Webpacker

Webpacker sometimes doesn't give clear indications of what's wrong when it
doesn't work.

**If you see repeated 'Webpacker compiling...' messages in the Rails server
log**, a good place to start debugging is by running the webpack compiler via
`bin/webpack`. This will give a much faster feedback loop than making requests
using a web browser.

**If you get `Webpacker::Manifest::MissingEntryError`s**, this usually points
to a problem in the compilation process which is causing one or more files not
to be created. Make sure that your yarn packages are up to date using `yarn
check` before proceeding to debug using `bin/webpack`.

**If assets work in dev but not in tests**, first confirm that you can compile
by invoking `bin/webpack`. If all is well, there is a chance that
`public/packs-test` contains stale output. Delete it and re-run the suite.
