# Developer On-boarding

## Purpose

This document describes the on-boardng steps for new Developers when they join the team.

## PaaS/DevOps steps

### Get a PaaS account
You can get an account by requesting one in the `#digital-tools-support` Slack channel. Request an account with a SpaceDeveloper role for your @digital.education.gov.uk email address with access to the `dfe` organisation and `bat-prod`, `bat-staging` and `bat-qa` spaces.

### Install the CloudFoundary CLI
PaaS is built on CloudFoundary and we use the CloudFoundary CLI to interact with PaaS. You can install version 7 of the CLI [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads).

### Getting familiar with PaaS
See [PaaS cheatsheet](/docs/paas-cheatsheet.md).
