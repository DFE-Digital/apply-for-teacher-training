### Who we are

Apply for teacher training (‘Apply’) and Manage teacher training applications (‘Manage’) are run by the Department for Education (‘we’) for the purpose of recruiting teachers.

### Why our use of your personal data is lawful

In order for our use of your personal data to be lawful, we need to meet one (or more) conditions in the data protection legislation. For Apply and Manage we rely on:

- article 6(1)(e) UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), to perform a public task carried out in the public interest as part of our function as a department
- article 9(2)(g) UK GDPR reasons of substantial public interest (with a basis in law)
- schedule 1(18) Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018)

This is done under section 132 of the Education Act 2002, together with regulation 5 of the Education (School Teachers’ Qualifications) (England) Regulations 2003.

### When we are joint data controllers

DfE and training providers are joint data controllers of data inside the Apply and Manage services from the point of collection until the data is shared with a training provider’s own systems.

### When we are independent data controllers

Once the application data is shared with or copied into a training provider’s own systems, the DfE and the providers are independently accountable under the UK GDPR and DPAt 2018 for your data as data controllers.
Each data controller is responsible for complying with data protection legislation.

### The personal data we collect and how we collect it

The personal data we collect will depend on whether you are a candidate, work for a training provider or give a reference.

#### The data we collect if you give a reference

If a candidate says that you can give them a reference, they’ll tell us:
