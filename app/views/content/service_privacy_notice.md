### Who we are

Apply for teacher training (‘Apply’) and Manage teacher training applications (‘Manage’) are run by the Department for Education (‘we’) for the purpose of recruiting teachers.

### Why our use of your personal data is lawful

In order for our use of your personal data to be lawful, we need to meet one (or more) conditions in the data protection legislation. For Apply and Manage we rely on:

- article 6(1)(e) UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), to perform a public task carried out in the public interest as part of our function as a department
- article 9(2)(g) UK GDPR reasons of substantial public interest (with a basis in law)
- schedule 1(18) Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018)

This is done under section 132 of the Education Act 2002, together with regulation 5 of the Education (School Teachers’ Qualifications) (England) Regulations 2003.

### When we are joint data controllers

DfE and training providers are joint data controllers of data inside the Apply and Manage services from the point of collection until the data is shared with a training provider’s own systems.

### When we are independent data controllers

Once the application data is shared with or copied into a training provider’s own systems, the DfE and the providers are independently accountable under the UK GDPR and DPAt 2018 for your data as data controllers.
Each data controller is responsible for complying with data protection legislation.

### The personal data we collect and how we collect it

The personal data we collect will depend on whether you’re a candidate or a referee.

### Who we share your data with

We need to share personal data for the purpose of recruiting high quality teachers.

#### Sharing data with providers

We share teacher training candidate and referee data with the providers to which the candidate has applied.

We have a data sharing agreement with providers so that they are clear about their responsibilities as data controllers in their own right. As data controllers they are required to comply with the UK GDPR and DPA2018 including to inform you through a privacy notice like this one, as to what they will be doing with your data and your information rights.

#### Sharing candidate data with referees

We’ll share candidate names with referees so that each referee can identify the candidate and give a reference.

We’ll share additional information to help the referee identify the candidate, such as how the candidate knows the referee.

#### External organisations who process data

We share data with our data processors for the purposes of provision of this service. Data protection agreements are in place with each of these processors and they are required to comply with the UK GDPR and the DPA 2018 as data processors.
