## How we use your data when you use Apply for teacher training

Apply for teacher training is part of the Department for Education.

Department for Education (referred to as ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our’) uses and looks after the personal data that you give when using Apply for teacher training.

We also share your data with the teacher training providers you apply to so that they can use and look after your data.

Under data protection law, this means the relevant teacher training providers and the Department for Education are ‘joint controllers’ for your data.

We have a data sharing agreement with [teacher training providers](#teacher-training-providers) so that they can only use your data for specific purposes.

This page explains what data we collect, how we use and look after it, who we share it with, and how to contact us about your data.

## What personal data we collect

We collect the following personal data:

* name
* address
* date of birth
* phone number
* email address
* any other personal data that you choose to include in your application form, such as whether you’re disabled

## How we use your data

### Processing your application

We will use your data to process your application. This means:

* sending your application to your choice(s) of training provider
* managing some communications between you and your choice(s) of training provider
* managing communications between your referee(s) and your choice(s) of training provider
* working out any funding you’re entitled to
* getting in touch with you if necessary, regarding your application or your data

### Improving Apply for teacher training

### Getting insight to make government policy better

We might look at the information in your application form to get insight into teacher training applicants. This will help us improve government policy.

## Making sure using your personal data is lawful

We need to use your data for the purposes listed above. These purposes are a ‘public task’, outlined in data protection legislation.

## Who we share your data with

We need to share your data for the purposes listed above.

We will share your data with:

1. ### Teacher training providers

    Your application form will be sent to the training providers you have applied to, who will use your data according to the data sharing agreement we have with them.

    This agreement says that a provider can use your data to get in touch with you regarding your application or your data, make decisions on your application, get statistics for internal use, and enrol you if you’re successful.

2. ### Your referees

    We will share your name with your referees so they can identify you and provide a reference. To help them identify you, we may need to share a bit more information about you, such as when you worked or studied with them.

3. ### UCAS

    We will share your personal data with UCAS so that they can check if you’re using their system as well, and if so, that you’re using it correctly. For example, we may contact you if UCAS tell us that you’ve accepted offers on both UCAS and Apply for teacher training.

4. ### External organisations who process data

    #### Customer service systems

    We use a customer service management system to process some of your data - for example, if you get in touch with us to give us feedback. Zendesk are currently our preferred customer service management system: [they use various safeguards to look after your data](https://www.zendesk.co.uk/company/customers-partners/master-subscription-agreement/?cta=msa#confidentiality).

    #### Google

    When you use our service, we’ll ask you if you want to consent to our use of cookies so that we can get statistics from Google Analytics. If you do so, Google may be able to retrieve your IP address. We use Google Analytics for statistics and won’t identify you personally from these.

    During the pilot of the service we will also use the Google’s G Suite to process some personal data. For example, we’ll ask your referees to send a reference via Google Forms and process data using Google Sheets. According to the agreement we have with Google, they won’t access the data we hold within G Suite.

    #### Hosting services

    We host our service on Microsoft Azure Cloud, which encrypts your data to prevent it being accessed by unauthorised people.

## How long we keep your data

We only keep your data for as long as needed for the uses listed above.

We will delete your data after 7 years.

## Your rights

Under the Data Protection Act 2018, you have the right to find out what data we have about you. These include the right to:

* be informed about how your data is being used
* access personal data
* have incorrect data updated
* have data erased
* stop or restrict the processing of your data
* get and reuse your data for different services
* object to how your data is processed in certain circumstances
