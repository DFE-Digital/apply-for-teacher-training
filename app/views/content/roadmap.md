###This is our current roadmap, which takes us through to the end of the 2021 recruitment cycle.

Last updated: 24th May 2021

##For candidates
###Recent changes
* Encouraged candidates to showcase their skills and achievements by [adding a full work history](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/apply-for-teacher-training/work-history-iteration/)
* Improved guidance around qualification requirements to encourage candidates to add A levels to their application
* Improved the information candidates see about the progress of their application after submitting their application
* Showing candidates where they can improve their application based on feedback from providers on previous applications, for example if they need to improve their personal statement
* Signposting the teacher training adviser service more effectively so that unsuccessful candidates can access the support they need to be successful in future

###Working on now
* Improving how location-based search works on Find postgraduate teacher training to help candidates find courses near them

##For providers
###Recent changes
* Collection of structured reasons when withdrawing an offer or when an application is rejected by default
* Enabled filtering a list of applications by subject
* Allow providers to make unconditional offers at stage 1, with support in the API

###Working on now
* Enable providers to receive appropriate and useful email notifications
* Enable providers to [customise which email notifications they receive](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/manage-teacher-training-applications/managing-individual-email-notifications/)
* Withdrawing applications that candidates have decided to withdraw instead of rejecting them or leaving them to be rejected by default
* [Withdrawing applications at candidates’ request](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/manage-teacher-training-applications/withdrawing-an-application-iteration-2/)
* Offering PE with EBacc to exceptional candidates instead of opening a new course on Publish
