Users can view applications to courses if they belong to the training provider or accredited body.

If they have the appropriate user permissions, they can also:

- manage interviews
- manage users - this includes adding users and setting user permissions
- manage organisations - this includes setting organisation permissions

These user permissions are not affected by organisation permissions.

## User permissions which are affected by organisation permissions

Users can be given permission to:

- send offers, invitations and rejections
- view criminal record and professional misconduct information
- view sex, disability and ethnicity information

These user permissions are affected by organisation permissions for courses run with partner organisations. Organisation permissions reflect the working relationship between 2 organisations.

For example, a user will only be able to make an offer if both:

- the user has the user permission to send offers, invitations and rejections
- the user’s organisation has the organisation permission to send offers, invitations and rejections for courses it runs with its partner organisation

There are no organisation permissions for courses run without partner organisations. Users only need to have the appropriate user permissions.
