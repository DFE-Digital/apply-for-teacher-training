Thank you for taking part in trialling Manage teacher training applications. Here’s what you can expect from us, and what we ask of you, over the course of the pilot.

## What you can expect from us

1. ### Designated support

    We will have designated support to answer your queries. You can contact us by:
    * phone: INSERT TELEPHONE NUMBER
    * email: <becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk>

    Unfortunately, we can’t offer support over the weekend.

2. ### Assistance for candidates

    Our advisors will be on hand to guide candidates through the application process and help with any technical issues they have when using the service.

3. ### Keeping to ‘decline by default’ time frames

    If a candidate hasn’t replied to an offer within 10 working days of receiving it, we will decline the offer by default. We’ll let you know if this is the case.

4. ### Letting you know about important updates

    We’ll let you know if a candidate changes their personal details, up until the point of enrolment.

## What we can’t provide yet

1. ### Fraud and plagiarism checks

    We won’t be able to carry out fraud and plagiarism checks during the pilot. If you wish to do this, please organise this separately.

2. ### Tracking conditions and interviews

    Manage teacher training applications isn’t set up yet to record:
    * conditions you set when making an offer
    * information about whether candidates have been invited for an interview

    Please record this information separately.

## What we ask of you

1. ### Respond to candidates within a set timeframe

    Please make an offer or reject a candidate within 40 working days of receiving an application. There may be some leniency on this if it falls over the Christmas or Easter holidays.

    We will reject the application by default if you don’t communicate a decision within this timeframe.

2. ### Make an offer according to our policies

    Make offers and include any conditions through Manage teacher training applications. This information will be sent to the candidate.

    Once a candidate has accepted an offer, you can’t change the terms of the offer without the candidate’s permission. If necessary, you can change conditions up until this point.

    Don’t pressure candidates into making a decision or withdraw an offer if the applicant has told you that they’re waiting to hear back from other providers.

    Contact us at <becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk> as soon as possible if you need to withdraw an offer - for example, if a candidate has given information that isn’t true or if you’re not running a course anymore.

3. ### Give feedback when rejecting a candidate

    If you decide to reject a candidate, do this using Manage teacher training applications. We’ll ask you to explain why you rejected them. This feedback will be sent to the candidate and to us.

4. ### Let us know when a candidate meets their conditions

    Please let us know as soon as possible when a candidate has met their conditions. If they didn’t meet the conditions, please contact us at <becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk>. This will help us get insight into teacher recruitment to inform our future policy.

5. ### Follow up with our user researchers

    Our user research team will be in touch by phone or email to ask for your feedback on your experience. This is so that we can build a better teacher training application process.

    Your feedback is invaluable to us. We’ll work around you to organise one-to-one sessions at the following stages:
    * after you’ve made several offers or rejections
    * after several candidates have met their conditions

    Please contact us at <becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk> to let us know how you prefer to be contacted.
