    <p class="govuk-body">The Apply sandbox is a test environment which allows you to experience the service as a candidate, training provider and software vendor.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You can:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>sign in as a candidate and submit an application</li>
      <li>sign in as a training provider and process an application</li>
      <li>test Apply’s <%= govuk_link_to 'API integrations', 'https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/api-docs' %></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">Throughout, you’ll be able to give us feedback so we can improve the service.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Course data in the sandbox</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body"><strong>The live Apply service</strong> gets its course data from the <%= govuk_link_to 'Teacher training courses API', t('teacher_training_courses_api.documentation_url') %>. Training providers update those courses using <%= govuk_link_to 'Publish teacher training courses', t('publish_teacher_training_courses.production_url') %>.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body"><strong>The Apply sandbox</strong> gets its course data from a sandbox version of the Teacher training courses API. As a training provider you can access <%= govuk_link_to 'a sandbox version of Publish', t('publish_teacher_training_courses.sandbox_url') %> where you’ll be able to create and edit courses just as you would on the live service, and see them on the <%= govuk_link_to 'sandbox version of Find postgraduate teacher training', t('find_postgraduate_teacher_training.sandbox_url') %>.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">To request access to the Publish sandbox, email us at <%= bat_contact_mail_to %>.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Get started as a candidate</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">You’ll be asked to enter your email address to open a candidate account in the Apply sandbox.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Please do not use anybody else’s address, as the system will generate real emails as part of the test.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Any other data you enter should be anonymised or invented.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">A note on references</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">In the live service, an application is only sent to a provider when 2 references have been supplied.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">In the Apply sandbox, to avoid testers having to request real references, we’ve enabled dummy referee email addresses:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>refbot1@example.com</li>
      <li>refbot2@example.com</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">In sandbox, enter these email addresses to generate 2 references for your test application.</p>

    <%= govuk_start_button(
      text: 'Continue as a candidate',
      href: candidate_interface_account_path,
    ) %>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Get started as a training provider</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">To test the service as a training provider, you’ll need to open a Department for Education (DfE) Sign-In account.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Email <%= bat_contact_mail_to %> to request access.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Test as a candidate</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">From the provider interface in the sandbox, you’ll be able to sign in as a specific candidate. This is useful if you have generated test applications via the API.</p>

    <%= govuk_start_button(
      text: 'Continue as a training provider',
      href: provider_interface_path,
    ) %>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Get started with the API</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">Our API allows you to integrate your software with our service.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">In the sandbox, you’ll be able to test your integration. You’ll also be able to generate dummy applications to process as a training provider.</p>

    <%= govuk_start_button(
      text: 'Review our API documentation',
      href: 'https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/api-docs',
    ) %>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Help and support</h2>
