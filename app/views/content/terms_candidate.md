## Applying for teacher training courses

### Stage 1: Submitting your initial application

You can apply for a total of 3 courses.

### Stage 2: Apply again if your application was not successful

You can apply for another course at this stage if you do not get an offer or if you choose not to accept your offers.

[<%= t('service_name.get_into_teaching') %>](<%= t('get_into_teaching.url') %>) can guide you through the process of applying for more courses. Contact them for free on <%= t('get_into_teaching.tel') %>, or [chat to an adviser using the online chat service](<%= t('get_into_teaching.url_online_chat') %>).

### Making changes to your application

Once you submit your application it is automatically sent to the training provider. To change your application after you’ve submitted it, contact us as soon as possible at <%= bat_contact_mail_to %>.

You can ask us to add courses (if you have not reached your limit of 3) and change your name and contact details too.

If you have heard back from your training provider, for example if they have turned down your application, we will not be able to change your choice of course.

### Withdrawing your application

You can withdraw your application at any point, even after you have accepted an offer.

[Sign in to your account](<%= candidate_interface_sign_in_path %>) and click ‘withdraw’ next to the course you want to withdraw.

### Outcome of your application

The Department of Education does not decide on your application. The course provider does.

If a course provider does not make a decision within 40 working days your application will automatically be turned down.

You have 10 working days to accept or decline an offer from a training provider.

The 10 days starts once you’ve heard back from all of the course providers you have applied to.

## How we check your suitability for working with children

All candidates must have an enhanced DBS check. This will show up any spent or unspent criminal convictions.

Not all convictions will stop you from teaching. [Talk to your provider about their policy on criminal convictions](https://www.gov.uk/exoffenders-and-employment).

Your name will also be checked against a DBS list of people who have been barred from working with children.

## Questions or support

If you need technical support, email <%= bat_contact_mail_to %>.

We respond within 5 working days, or 1 working day for more urgent queries.

For advice on teacher training, [call us or chat online](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/#talk-to-us).
