Thank you for using Apply for teacher training, a service run by the

Using Apply for teacher training means you agree to these terms of use.

## How to apply for teacher training courses

### Stage 1: submitting your initial application(s)

You can apply for up to 3 courses through Apply for teacher training at this
stage. You can also apply to 3 courses through UCAS if you want to.

**You can only accept 1 offer**, even if you use both services.

### Stage 2: trying again if your application wasn’t successful

You can apply for more courses at this stage if:

* you’re rejected by your choices
* you decline the offers you receive
* you withdraw your application from your choices

[Get Into Teaching](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/get-help-and-support)
can guide you through the process of applying for more courses. Contact them on
Freephone 0800 389 2500, or [chat to an adviser using the online chat
service](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/lp/live-chat).

### Making changes to your application

Get in touch with us within 5 working days of submitting your application if
you need to make any amends. For example, you can add more courses (if you
haven’t reached your limit of 3) or change your course choices. Once we’ve
processed your request, we won’t be able to make any more changes for you.

However, you can ask us to amend your name or contact details at any point up
until enrolment.

Contact us at <becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk> if you need to make
changes.

We’ll let your training provider(s) know about any amends.

### Withdrawing your application

You can withdraw your application to your course(s) at any point, even after
you’ve accepted an offer.

Contact us at <becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk> if you need to do
this.

We’ll let your training provider(s) know.

### Declaring that what you’ve said is true

Before you submit your application, we’ll ask you to confirm that the
information you’ve given is true, complete and accurate.

## How we check your suitability for working with children

All candidates must agree to have an enhanced DBS check. This will show up any
spent or unspent criminal convictions.

Not all convictions will stop you from teaching. [Talk to your provider about
their policy on criminal convictions](https://www.gov.uk/exoffenders-and-employment).

Your name will also be checked against a DBS list of people who have been barred
from working with children.

## How you can contact us

Contact [Get Into Teaching](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/get-help-and-support) on Freephone 0800 389 2500, or [chat to an adviser using the online
chat service](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/lp/live-chat).

We typically respond within one working day for urgent queries. It can take up
to five working days for less urgent queries. Unfortunately, we can’t provide
support over the weekend.
