### Apply again if your application does not lead to a place

You can apply again if your initial application does not lead to a place.

This might be because you:

* withdraw your application

You can apply again as many times as you like.

Each time you submit an application you can apply for up to 3 courses.

[Chat online for help applying again](<%= t('get_into_teaching.url_online_chat') %>).

### Making changes to your application

Once you submit your application it’s sent to your teacher training providers straight away.

Contact us within 5 working days at <%= bat_contact_mail_to %> if you need to change something.

You can ask us to update your personal or contact details any time.

### Withdrawing your application

You can withdraw your application at any point, even after you’ve accepted an offer.

[Sign in to your account to withdraw an application](<%= candidate_interface_sign_in_path %>).

### Application outcome

If your teacher training provider does not make a decision about your application by their deadline, your application to their course cannot progress. Providers normally have 40 working days to make a decision.

Once you receive decisions from all of your providers, you have 10 working days to accept or decline any offers. If you do not respond to your offers within this timeframe, they’ll be automatically declined.

## Criminal convictions

You'll need to have an enhanced DBS check if you accept a place on a course. This will show up any spent or unspent criminal convictions.

Not all convictions will stop you from teaching. Talk to your provider about their policy on [criminal convictions](https://www.gov.uk/exoffenders-and-employment).

Your name will also be checked against a DBS list of people who’ve been barred from working with children.

## Your account

When you start your application an account will be created for you. Refer to our [privacy policy](<%= candidate_interface_privacy_policy_path %>) to find out how we keep your data safe.

You do not need a password to sign in to your account. You'll get a unique and secure link via email instead.
