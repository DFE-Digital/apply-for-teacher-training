We recognise that training providers continue to work under very difficult conditions. We previously announced that we won’t reject or decline any offers automatically until 20 April 2020. **We’ve now extended that date to 31 May 2020**.

Below we outline what this means for you and your candidates. We’ll keep you updated if anything else changes.

## Giving you more time before applications are rejected by default (RBD)

### Applications that have been submitted already

You have until 23:59 on 31 May to make decisions on applications which would normally be automatically rejected on or before 31 May.

For applications which have a RBD date after 31 May, you’ll also have more time to make a decision. We’ll add an extra 6 weeks to the response deadlines.

### Applications that are submitted between now and 31 May

If applications come in between now and 31 May, you have until 23:59 on 24 July to respond. No applications in this category will be automatically rejected until then.

### How to keep track of your new RBD dates

You can see your new RBD dates in [Manage teacher training applications](/provider/applications).

### Keeping candidates up to date

We’ll let candidates know that it might take you longer to respond to their application, and tell them your new RBD date.

## Giving candidates more time to make decisions on offers

### Hearing back from candidates might take longer

We’re pausing all automatic decline by default (DBD) dates until 31 May. This means that there may be a delay hearing back from any candidates who would normally have to respond to an offer on or before 31 May. We’re giving everyone in this category until 23:59 on 31 May to respond.

There may also be a delay hearing back from candidates who have a DBD date after 31 May. For example, if you made the offer before 31 May, a candidate will have a bit more time than the usual 10 days to respond because we’re pausing the system until 31 May.

### How to keep track of candidates’ new DBD dates

You can find candidates’ new DBD dates in [Manage teacher training applications](/provider/applications).

### Keeping candidates up to date

We’ll let candidates know if they have longer to respond to an offer and tell them their new DBD date.  

## What we ask of you during this time

### Keep your vacancy statuses up to date

Please update the statuses of your training programmes to tell potential applicants if you’re not recruiting at the moment.
