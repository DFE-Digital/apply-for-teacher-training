# Your courses are now live on Apply and you can access Manage teacher training applications

Dear colleague,

Your courses have been switched on on Apply for teacher training. Candidates can now apply for your courses through the service.

You also now have access to [Manage teacher training applications](https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/provider). Sign in to Manage to review and respond to any applications you receive. you will also get a notification email when you receive any applications.

# Is UCAS still running?

Your courses will be available to candidates on both UCAS and on Apply until October <%=@current_recruitment_cycle_year%>. After that date, candidates will only be able to submit applications through Apply.

If you need any more information about either Apply or Manage,  contact us at  [becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk](mailto:becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk). Weâ€™re also keen to hear about your experiences of both services, so please do send us your feedback.


Regards,
Becoming a Teacher team
