Dear <%= @provider_user_name || 'colleague' %>

<%= @application.candidate_name %>'s application to study <%= @application.course_name_and_code %> was automatically rejected.

This is because you did not respond within <%= @application.rbd_days %> working days.

<% if @provider_can_give_feedback %>
  You need to tell <%= @application.candidate_name %> why their application was unsuccessful:
  <%= provider_interface_application_choice_url(@application.application_choice_id) %>
<% end %>
