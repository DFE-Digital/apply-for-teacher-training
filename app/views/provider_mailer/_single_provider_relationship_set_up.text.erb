Candidates can now find courses on GOV.UK that you work on with:

<% @relationships_to_set_up.values.flatten.each do |partner_organisation| -%>
- <%= partner_organisation %>
<% end -%>

Either you or these partner organisations must set up organisation permissions before you can manage teacher training applications.
