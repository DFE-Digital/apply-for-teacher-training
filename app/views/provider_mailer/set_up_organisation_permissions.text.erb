Dear <%= @provider_user.full_name || 'colleague' %>

<% if @multiple_relationships -%>
Candidates can now find courses on GOV.UK that you work on with the partner organisations listed below.

You cannot manage applications to these courses until either you or your partner organisations have set up organisational permissions.

<% @relationships_to_set_up.each do |organisation, partner_organisations| -%>

For <%= organisation %>, you need to set up permissions for courses you work on with:

<% partner_organisations.each do |partner_organisation| -%>
- <%= partner_organisation %>
<% end %>
<% end -%>

<% else -%>
Candidates can now find courses on GOV.UK that you work on with:

<% @relationships_to_set_up.values.flatten.each do |partner_organisation| -%>
- <%= partner_organisation %>
<% end -%>

Either you or these partner organisations must set up organisation permissions before you can manage teacher training applications.

<% end -%>
Youâ€™ll be asked to set up organisation permissions when you sign in, unless your partner organisations set them up first.
