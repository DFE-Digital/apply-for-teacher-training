Dear <%= @provider_user.full_name || 'colleague' %>

Candidates can now find courses on GOV.UK that you work on with:

<% @partner_organisations.each do |organisation| -%>
- <%= organisation.name %>
<% end -%>

Either you or these partner organisations must set up organisation permissions before you can manage teacher training applications.

Youâ€™ll be asked to set up organisation permissions when you sign in, unless your partner organisations set them up first.
