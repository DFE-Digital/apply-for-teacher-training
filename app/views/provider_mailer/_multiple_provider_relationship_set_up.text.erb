Candidates can now find courses you run with the partner organisations listed below.

You cannot manage applications to these courses until either you or your partner organisations have set up organisation permissions.

<% @relationships_to_set_up.each do |organisation, partner_organisations| -%>

For <%= organisation %>, you need to set up permissions for courses you work on with:

<% partner_organisations.each do |partner_organisation| -%>
- <%= partner_organisation %>
<% end %>
<% end -%>

You will be asked to set up organisation permissions when you sign in, unless your partner organisations set them up first.
