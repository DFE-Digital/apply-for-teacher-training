Candidates can now find courses on GOV.UK that you work on with the partner organisations listed below.

You cannot manage applications to these courses until either you or your partner organisations have set up organisational permissions.

<% @relationships_to_set_up.each do |organisation, partner_organisations| -%>

For <%= organisation %>, you need to set up permissions for courses you work on with:

<% partner_organisations.each do |partner_organisation| -%>
- <%= partner_organisation %>
<% end %>
<% end -%>
