## 2nd July

Documentation:

Add clarification in the identifier fields for `support_reference`, `application.id` and `candidate.id` in the documentation.

## 28th June

## 3rd June

`HESAITTData` now includes the following optional fields:

- `other_disability_details` will contain the candidate’s description of their disability if they selected “Other” and entered a value. This corresponds to HESA disability code `96`
- `other_ethnicity_details` will contain the candidate’s description of their ethnicity if they selected “Other” and entered a value.

## 5th May

The following experimental/sandbox endpoint has been updated:

`/test-data/generate` now accepts optional `for_training_courses` and `for_test_provider_courses` query params.

Supplying `for_training_courses=true` will ensure that applications are generated for courses run by the organisation.
Supplying `for_test_provider_courses=true` will ensure that applications are generated for courses run by a separate, sandbox only, test provider.
Supplying none of `for_ratified_courses`, `for_training_courses` or `for_test_provider_courses` as `true`, will result in applications being generated to courses run by the organisation (the same effect as just `for_training_courses=true`)


## 26th April

Add [documentation](/api-docs#how-candidates-and-applications-are-identified) about application and candidate IDs

## 16th April

`Qualification` now includes an optional `subject_code` field. This contains the HECoS code for the subject if it is available

## 15th April

Changes to existing attributes:

- Update the return values of the `rejection` object `reason` field to return `Not entered` if there is no rejection reason yet provided on an application rejected by default.

## 31st March

`Qualification.grade` now has a value of `Not entered` when the candidate did not provide a value. This used to be `null`, though we promised a string.

## 22nd March

The following experimental/sandbox endpoint has been updated:

`/test-data/generate` is now asynchronous:

- A POST request to this endpoint will queue a job to generate the specified test applications.
- The list of created application IDs will no longer be returned.
- The new applications will become available as soon as they have been generated.
- Applications generated in this way will now have their `updated_at` set to the current time, so they can be retrieved using the `GET /applications` endpoint with the `since` parameter.

## 19th March

Fix a bug where HESA ITT data was not being returned for applications with accepted offers.

## 9th March

Changes to existing attributes:

- Update return values of `uk_residency_status` to correspond with candidate application options. Removes 'Candidate does not know' and the value 'Candidate needs to apply for permission to work and study in the UK' is returned where the candidate has answered `no` or `decide_later`.

New attributes:

- Adds `uk_residency_status_code` field. Single alphabetical character code for the candidate’s UK residency status indicating their right to work and study in the UK.

## 29th February

- deprecate `Qualification.awarding_body` as this field has always been null.

## 26th February

New attributes:

- `Candidate` now has a `fee_payer` attribute of type string, returning a two-digit string corresponding to UCAS Fee Payer codes. It indicates a provisional fee payer status. Its value is derived from the candidate's nationality, residency status and domicile.

Documentation:

## 25th February

- Documentation updated to indicate that the `Candidate.domicile` field is encoded as a HESA DOMICILE code.

## 5th February

The following experimental/sandbox endpoint has been updated:

- `/test-data/generate` now accepts an optional `for_ratified_courses` query param. If this parameter is supplied and set to a non-empty string, applications will be generated for courses the organisation awards, not runs. This means subsequent calls to `/test-data/clear` will NOT delete these applications.

## 29th January

- The documented enum values for `Reference.referee_type` have been corrected to remove commas and replace `school-based` with `school_based`.

## 17th December

- The `Rejection` `reason` field may now return more complex 'structured' reasons for rejection. The field type remains `string`. The field contains details and advice about the rejected application as seen by the candidate, grouped under relevant headings.

## 16th December 2020

Changes to existing attributes:

- The `domicile` attribute of `Candidate` has been updated to return two-letter HESA codes instead of ISO 3166-2 country codes. For most international addresses the two types of code are identical, but HESA domicile codes do not include a `GB` value, specifying the country instead (e.g. `XF` for England, `XI` for Wales etc.)

## 15th December 2020

Changes to existing attributes:

- The `equivalency_details` attribute of `Qualification` will now contain a NARIC code and its description, if these are avalailable. Example: 'Naric: 4000123456 - Between GCSE and GCSE AS Level - Equivalent to GCSE C'

## 5th October 2020

Changes to existing attributes:

## 10th August 2020

- `POST /application/:id/offer` is now idempotent and will continue to return 200 if the same offer details are POSTed repeatedly
- `POST /application/:id/offer` now supports changing the conditions on an offer while retaining the original offered course. Previously this returned a 422 error saying it was necessary to offer a different course.
- Deprecate `Withdrawal.reason`, which was supposed to hold a candidate’s reason for withdrawing their application. The Apply service will not collect this information

## 7th July 2020

Documentation has been amended to emphasise the stability of `/applications` endpoints in contrast to the `/test-data` endpoints.

Experimental endpoints have also been updated:

- `/test-data/regenerate` endpoint has been deactivated. The response contains an explanatory error message.
