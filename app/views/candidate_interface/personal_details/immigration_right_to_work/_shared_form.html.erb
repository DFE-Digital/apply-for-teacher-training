  You need a visa or immigration status that allows you to work or study in the UK while you do your teacher training.
  You can use a visa which is due to expire before the end of your course, as long as you have the right to renew it.

  If you do not have the right to work or study, you can apply for a visa when you have been accepted onto a course that
  sponsors visas.
