        Teacher training providers need to check that it’s safe for you to work
        with children and young people.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        As well as confirming your identity and your right to work in the UK,
        providers will check:

        <li>your criminal record in the UK (they’ll do an enhanced <%= govuk_link_to 'DBS check', 'https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service/about#dbs-checks', target: '_blank' %>) and abroad where relevant</li>
        <li>whether you’ve been banned from teaching or working with children</li>
        <li>your professional behaviour, such as whether you’ve been removed from teacher training and what your referees say about you</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Tell your provider about any potential safeguarding issues, such as
        offences, cautions, reprimands and final warnings. They can give advice
        about whether this will affect your application.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">It won’t necessarily stop you becoming a teacher.</p>
