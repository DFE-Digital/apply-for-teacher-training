  Teacher training providers need to check that it’s safe for you to work
  with children and young people.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  As well as confirming your identity and your right to work in the UK,
  providers will check:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>your criminal record in the UK (they’ll do an enhanced <%= govuk_link_to 'Disclosure and Barring Service check', 'https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service/about#dbs-checks', target: '_blank' %>) and abroad where relevant</li>
  <li>whether you’ve been banned from teaching or working with children</li>
  <li>your professional behaviour, such as whether you’ve been removed from teacher training and what your referees say about you</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Tell your provider about any potential safeguarding issues, such as
  offences, cautions, reprimands and final warnings. They can give advice
  about whether this will affect your application.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">It will not necessarily stop you becoming a teacher.</p>
