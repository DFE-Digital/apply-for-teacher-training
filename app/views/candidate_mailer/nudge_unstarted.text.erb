  Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>

<% end %>
You recently created an account to apply for teacher training, but you haven’t started your application yet.

Here’s 2 things you could start thinking about to get going with your application.

# Choosing a course

You’ll choose the courses you want to apply for in the section of the application form called ‘Courses’. You can apply for up to 4 courses at a time.

Training providers offer places on courses as people apply through the year and courses stay open until they are full.

Some courses can fill up quickly, so you should apply as soon as you can if you want to start training in September 2023.

Once you submit your application, you’ll get email notifications to tell you when something has changed on your application.

# Writing your personal statement

Training providers use the personal statement to find out more about you and your motivations for wanting to teach.

Spending some time on your personal statement can really show your enthusiasm and help you stand out to training providers.

Within the application form, there is guidance to help think about what to write. You do not need to stick to it exactly, but it can help you get started.

You could speak to our teacher training advisers. They were teachers and can give you free, one-to-one support with your statement:

[<%= t('get_into_teaching.url_get_an_adviser_start') %>](<%= email_link_with_utm_params t('get_into_teaching.url_get_an_adviser_start'), 'nudge_unstarted', @application_form.phase %>)

# Get help

Call 0800 389 2500 or chat online:

[<%= t('get_into_teaching.url_talk_to_us') %>](<%= email_link_with_utm_params t('get_into_teaching.url_talk_to_us'), GetUnstartedApplicationsReadyToNudge::MAIL_TEMPLATE, @application_form.phase %>)

Monday to Friday, 8:30am to 5:30pm (except public holidays).
