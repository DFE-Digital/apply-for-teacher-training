Hello <%= @application_form.first_name %>

You have not applied to any teacher training courses yet.

[Sign in to your account to apply for up to 4 courses](<%= application_choices_link %>).

Popular courses fill up quickly and places are allocated as soon as people apply. Submit your application as soon as you are ready to avoid missing out on a limited number of course places.

You may need to complete a [subject knowledge enhancement](<%= email_link_with_utm_params(t('get_into_teaching.url_subject_knowledge_enhancement'), 'nudge_unsubmitted_with_incomplete_courses', @application_form.phase) %>) (SKE) course and other conditions before starting your training.

[Apply now to make sure you have enough time](<%= application_choices_link %>)

Some subjects and courses have bursaries of up to £29,000 and scholarships of up to £31,000. These courses fill up more quickly than other courses.
