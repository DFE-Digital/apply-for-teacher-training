# How you sign in to Apply for teacher training is changing

During the week of 27 January, users will begin signing in using GOV.UK One Login. You'll be able to create a GOV.UK One Login if you do not already have one.

You should use the same email address to create your GOV.UK One Login that you use to sign in to Apply for teacher training. This is so you keep the existing information in your account.

If you use a different email address you’ll be able to transfer your account details after you sign in.

# What is GOV.UK One Login?

GOV.UK One Login allows you to sign in to some government services using the same email address and password.

In the future you’ll be able to use your GOV.UK One Login to access all services on GOV.UK.
