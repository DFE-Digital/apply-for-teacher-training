Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>

# Your course is not available anymore

<%= @course_name_and_code %> at <%= @provider_name %> is not available anymore.

We cannot send your application to <%= @provider_name %> to be considered for this course.

# You may be able to find another course

Find out if there are any other suitable courses available:

<%= I18n.t('find_postgraduate_teacher_training.production_url') %>

If you find a course, [sign in to your account to add the course as soon as possible](<%= candidate_magic_link(@candidate) %>).

As soon as your references come in, your application will be sent for consideration for the courses youâ€™ve chosen - but not for any courses that are full.
