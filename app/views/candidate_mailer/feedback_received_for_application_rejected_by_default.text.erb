Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>,

# Feedback on your application

Your application for <%= @course_option.course.name_and_code %> was automatically rejected on <%= @application_choice.rejected_at.to_s(:govuk_date) %>.

This was because <%= @course_option.course.provider.name %> did not respond in time. They’ve now given you the following feedback:

^<%= @application_choice.rejection_reason&.gsub(/\n/,"\n^") %>

<%= render 'get_support' %>
