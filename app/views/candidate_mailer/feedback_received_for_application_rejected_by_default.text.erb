Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>

As you know, your application for <%= @course.name_and_code %> could not progress because <%= @course.provider.name %>
did not respond by their deadline.

Theyâ€™ve now given you the following feedback:

<%= render 'reasons_for_rejection_intro' %>
<%= render 'reasons_for_rejection' %>

<% if @show_apply_again_guidance %>
  If this feedback was useful, make any changes to your application before you apply again:

  <%= @candidate_magic_link %>
<% end %>
