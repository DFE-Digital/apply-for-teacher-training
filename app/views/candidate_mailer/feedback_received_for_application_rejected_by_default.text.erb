Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>

As you know, your application for <%= @course.name_and_code %> could not progress because <%= @course.provider.name %>
did not respond by their deadline of <%= @application_choice.rejected_at.to_s(:govuk_date) %>.

They’ve now given you the following feedback:

<%= render 'reasons_for_rejection_intro' %>
<%= render 'reasons_for_rejection' %>

<% if @show_apply_again_guidance %>
  If this feedback was useful, consider using it to strengthen your application and apply again:

  <%= @candidate_magic_link %>
<% end %>
