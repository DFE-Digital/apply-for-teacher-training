Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>,

You have chosen to stop sharing your application details with other training providers.

If you change your mind you can [change your settings](<%= @update_preferences_url %>).

If you were receiving invitations to courses that you were not interested in, you can [update your preferences](<%= @update_preferences_url %>) to appear in more relevant searches.

You can still apply to any courses that you have been invited to apply to, providing you have application choices left.
You will not receive any further invitations to apply.
