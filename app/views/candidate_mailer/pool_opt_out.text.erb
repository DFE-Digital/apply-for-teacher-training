Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>,

You have chosen not to share your application details with other training providers.

If you change your mind you can [change your settings](<%= @update_preferences_url %>). You can set preferences so you are only invited to courses you are interested in applying to.

Making your application details visible to other training providers improves your chances of receiving an offer to train to teach.

[Read more about application sharing](<%= @sharing_guidance_url %>).
