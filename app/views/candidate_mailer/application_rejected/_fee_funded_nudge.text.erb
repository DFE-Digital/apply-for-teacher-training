# Could you consider a course with fees to pay?

Salaried and apprenticeship routes are in high demand, you have a better chance of success if you apply to a course with fees to pay.

You could be eligible to get a scholarship or bursary to help you train:
* scholarships and bursaries do not have to be paid back.
* you can get a scholarship or bursary alongside tuition fee and maintenance loans.
* the exact amount you could receive will depend on the subject that you train to teach.

Select ‘fee - no salary’ from the filters in [Find teacher training courses](<%= @find_link %>) when you search.

Find out more about [funding your training](<%= @git_funding_link %>) on the Get Into Teaching website.
