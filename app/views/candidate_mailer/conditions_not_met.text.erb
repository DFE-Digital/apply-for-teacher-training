Hello <%= @application_form.first_name %>

Your application for <%= @application_choice.current_course_option.course.name_and_code %> has been unsuccessful. <%= @application_choice.current_course_option.course.provider.name %> have said that you do not meet these conditions of the offer they made to you:

<% @application_choice.offer.conditions.select(&:unmet?).each do |condition| %>
^ - <%= condition.text %>
<% end %>

Unfortunately, you will not be able to join the course. Contact <%= @application_choice.current_course_option.course.provider.name %> if you need further advice.

# You can apply again

You should make sure you will meet the conditions of any future offers first.

All courses will require a background and criminal records check known as a disclosure and barring service (DBS) check as a condition of their offer.

Some courses will require you to do a [subject knowledge enhancement](<%= t('get_into_teaching.url_if_conditions_not_met') %> ) (SKE) course, for example if your degree subject is in a subject that's different to the one you have applied to teach, or if you received your qualifications more than 5 years ago.

All courses will request references. Find out [how to choose people to give a reference for you](<%= t('get_into_teaching.url_references') %> ).
