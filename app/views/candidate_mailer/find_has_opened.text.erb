You can now find teacher training courses starting in the <%= @academic_year %> academic year.

[Find your courses](<%= I18n.t('find_teacher_training.production_url') %>).

You can start preparing your applications and submit them from <%= @apply_opens %>.

Courses can fill up quickly, so apply as soon as you can.

[Start preparing your applications](<%= sign_in_link %>).

Training providers offer places on courses as people apply throughout the year. Courses stay open until they are full.  Courses that sponsor visas can close earlier than other courses.
