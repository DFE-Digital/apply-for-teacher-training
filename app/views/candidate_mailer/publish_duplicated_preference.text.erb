Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>,

Last recruitment cycle you chose to share your application details with other training providers. You also set preferences for the types of courses you would be interested in receiving invitations to apply to.

Now that we are in a new recruitment cycle for courses starting in 2026, we would usually ask you to re-confirm that you want to share your application details and your preferences.

However, there was a technical problem that meant you did not see the screen asking you to re-confirm your choices.

We have kept your preferences from last cycle and copied them over to this cycle. This means that:

^ When you have no other choices that are awaiting a decision, your details will be visible to other training providers who can invite you to apply for their courses.

You can [change your preferences at any time](<%= @application_sharing_url %>).

[Read more about how application sharing works](<%= @how_preferences_work %>).

If you have any questions, please contact [becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk](mailto:becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk)
