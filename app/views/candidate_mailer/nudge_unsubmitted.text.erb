Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>

It looks like your teacher training application is ready to submit.

If you are ready, [sign in to your account to submit your application now](<%= candidate_magic_link(@application_form.candidate) %>).

A teacher training adviser could help with your application, if something is holding you back from submitting it. They can talk to you about teacher training and teaching as a career.
