Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>

It looks like your teacher training application is ready to submit.

If somethingâ€™s holding you back from submitting your application, we may be able to help.

Do you have a teacher training adviser yet? They can help you ensure that your application is as good as it can be.

As former teachers, they can also offer lots of insight into teacher training and teaching as a career.
