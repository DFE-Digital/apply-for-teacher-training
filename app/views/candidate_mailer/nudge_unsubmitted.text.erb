Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>

It looks like your teacher training application is ready to submit.

If you are ready, [sign in to your account to submit your application now](<%= application_choices_link %>).

Popular courses fill up quickly and places are allocated as soon as people apply. Submit your application as soon as you are ready to avoid missing out on a limited number of course places.

You may need to complete a [subject knowledge enhancement](<%= email_link_with_utm_params(t('get_into_teaching.url_subject_knowledge_enhancement'), 'nudge_unsubmitted', @application_form.phase) %>) (SKE) course and other conditions before starting your training.

[Apply now to make sure you have enough time](<%= application_choices_link %>)

Some subjects and courses have bursaries of up to £29,000 and scholarships of up to £31,000. These courses fill up more quickly than other courses.

[Check if your subject has a bursary or scholarship](<%= email_link_with_utm_params t('get_into_teaching.url_scholarships_and_bursaries_funding_widget'), 'nudge_unsubmitted', @application_form.phase %>)
