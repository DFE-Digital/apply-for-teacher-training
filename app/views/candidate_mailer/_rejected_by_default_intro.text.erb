Your application to study <%= @course.name_and_code %> cannot progress because <%= @course.provider.name %> did not make a decision before their deadline to respond.

Unless the provider has indicated that they want to progress your application, you should consider this application closed and choose another course or provider.

<%= @course.provider.name %> may still give you feedback on your application.
If you think this is a mistake (for example, the provider has invited you for an interview) let us know at becomingateacher@education.gov.uk.
