Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>

You have an offer from <%= @provider_name %> to study <%= @course_name %>.

<% if @conditions.blank? %>
  The provider has not set any conditions.
<% else %>
  <%= render "candidate_mailer/offer_conditions" %>
<% end %>

Contact <%= @provider_name %> if you have any questions about the offer.

<%= render "candidate_mailer/wait_or_respond" %>

# What to do if you’re unable to start training in <%= @start_date %>

Some teacher training providers allow you to defer your offer. This means that you could start your course a year later.

Every provider is different, so it may or may not be possible to do this. Find out by contacting <%= @provider_name %>.

Asking if it’s possible to defer will not affect your existing offer.

If <%= @provider_name %> agrees to defer your offer, you’ll need to accept the offer on your account first.
