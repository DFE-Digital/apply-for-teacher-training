Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>,

# You have an offer

Contact <%= @provider_name %> if you have any questions about this.

# Make a decision by <%= @application_choice.decline_by_default_at.to_s(:govuk_date) %>

# What to do if you’re unable to start training in <%= @start_date %>

Some teacher training providers allow you to defer your offer. This means that you could start your course a year later.

Every provider is different, so it may or may not be possible to do this. Find out by contacting <%= @provider_name %>.

Asking if it’s possible to defer will not affect your existing offer.

If <%= @provider_name %> agrees to defer your offer, you’ll need to accept the offer on your account first.
