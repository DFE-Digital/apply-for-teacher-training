Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>

You have an offer from <%= @provider_name %> to study <%= @course_name %>.

<% if @conditions.blank? %>
  They’ll let you know if they need further information before you can start training.
<% else %>
  <%= render "candidate_mailer/offer_conditions" %>
<% end %>

Contact <%= @provider_name %> if you have any questions about this.

# Respond by <%= @application_choice.decline_by_default_at.to_fs(:govuk_date) %>

If you do not respond by <%= @application_choice.decline_by_default_at.to_fs(:govuk_date) %>, your offers will be declined automatically.

<%= render "offer_list" %>

[Sign in to your account to respond to your offer](<%= candidate_magic_link(@application_choice.application_form.candidate) %>).

# What to do if you’re unable to start training in <%= @start_date %>

You can defer your offer which means that you could start your course a year later.

Contact <%= @provider_name %> to ask if it’s possible to defer, this will not affect your existing offer. If your provider agrees, you’ll need to accept the offer on your account first and then defer it.
