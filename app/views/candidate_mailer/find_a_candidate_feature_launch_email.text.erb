Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>,

There is a new feature in Apply for teacher training.

You can choose to make your application details visible to training providers who you have not submitted an application to.

They can search a list of candidates and view their application details. If they think you are suitable for their course, they can invite you to apply directly.

[Allow other providers to view your application details](<%= candidate_interface_candidate_feature_launch_email_url %>)

You can decide which locations you want to appear in searches for, so you will only be invited to courses in areas you have chosen yourself.

## How this works with the current application process

This feature should be used alongside the [current application process](<%= candidate_interface_guidance_url %>). You must continue to choose courses and submit applications yourself.

^Candidates who submit 4 or more applications are more likely to receive an offer to train to teach.

You can still submit up to 4 application choices at a time. If a provider invites you to apply and you submit an application, it will count towards your total.

You can change your decision to share your application details at any time by following the link at the bottom of your applications page.
