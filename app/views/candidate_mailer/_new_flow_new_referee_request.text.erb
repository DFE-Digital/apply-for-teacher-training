Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>

<% if @reason == :email_bounced %>

You asked <%= @reference.name %> for a reference for your teacher training application.

Your request did not reach <%= @reference.name %>. This could be because:

- there’s a problem with their email service
- you entered the wrong email address


It’s important that <%= @reference.application_form.application_choices.pending_conditions.first&.provider&.name %> receives your references as soon as possible.

- request the reference again - check the email address before you do this
- ask someone else for a reference
