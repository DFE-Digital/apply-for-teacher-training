Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>,

You have received invitations from training providers to apply to courses:

<% @invites.each do |invite| %>
  [<%= invite.course_name %>](<%= invite.url %>) received at <%= invite.sent_time %> on date <%= invite.sent_date %>
<% end %>

Because you have not responded to these invitations, we have hidden you from search results.

## Any applications you have already submitted or that you go on to submit yourself are not affected.

[Sign in to review and respond to your invites](<%= @invites_url %>)

You can either decline an invitation to a course or submit an application.
