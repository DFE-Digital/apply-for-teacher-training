Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>

You asked <%= @reference.name %> for a reference for your teacher training application. They have not replied yet.

We emailed them 2 days ago to remind them about your request. You can contact them yourself to ask if they are still happy to provide a reference.

You can sign in to your account to:

- send them an email to remind them that you have asked for a reference
- cancel the request for a reference
- ask someone else for a reference


[Sign in to your account](<%= sign_in_link %>).

<%= @provider_name %> must check your references before they can confirm your place on the course. Contact them if you need help getting references or choosing who to ask.

We will email <%= @reference.name %> again in a week if they still have not said they can provide a reference.
