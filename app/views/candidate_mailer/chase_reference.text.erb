<% if @application_form.show_new_reference_flow? %>
  Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>

  You asked <%= @reference.name %> for a reference for your teacher training application. They have not replied yet.

  You can sign into your account to:

  - send them an email to remind them that youâ€™ve asked for a reference
  - cancel the request for a reference
  - ask someone else for a reference


 [Sign into your account](<%= candidate_magic_link(@application_form.candidate) %>).

 <%= @application_form.application_choices.pending_conditions.first.provider.name %> must check your references before they can confirm your place on the course. Contact them if you need help getting references or choosing who to ask.

<% else %>
  <%= @reference.name %> has not responded yet.

  You can add as many referees as you like to increase the chances of getting 2 references quickly.

  You can also send one reminder to each referee from your account.

  [Manage your references](<%= candidate_magic_link(@application_form.candidate) %>).

  You cannot submit your application without 2 references. Courses can become full anytime - get your references as soon as possible.
<% end %>
