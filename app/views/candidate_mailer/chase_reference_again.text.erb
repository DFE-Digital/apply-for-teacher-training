  Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>

  You asked <%= @referee.name %> for a reference for your teacher training applicaiton. They have not replied yet.

  <%= @referee.application_form.application_choices.pending_conditions.first.provider.name %> needs to check your references before they can confirm your place on the course.

  You can sign into your account to:

  - ask someome else for a reference
  - send them, an email to remind them that youâ€™ve asked for a reference
  - cancel the request for a reference


  [Sign into your account](<%= candidate_magic_link(@application_form.candidate) %>).

  Contact <%= @referee.application_form.application_choices.pending_conditions.first.provider.name %> if you need help getting references or choosing who to ask.
<% else %>
  <%= @referee.name %> has not responded yet.

  You can add as many referees as you like to increase the chances of getting 2 references quickly.

  You can also send one reminder to each referee from your account.

  [Manage your references](<%= candidate_magic_link(@application_form.candidate) %>).

  You cannot submit your application without 2 references. Courses can become full anytime - get your references as soon as possible.
