Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>

You asked <%= @referee.name %> for a reference for your teacher training application. They have not replied yet.

We emailed them 30 days ago, 16 days ago and 2 days ago to remind them about your request. You can contact them yourself to ask if they are still happy to provide a reference.

<%= @provider_name %> needs to check your references before they can confirm your place on the course.

You can sign in to your account to:

- ask someone else for a reference
- send them an email to remind them that you have asked for a reference
- cancel the request for a reference


[Sign in to your account](<%= sign_in_link %>).

Find out more about who you should ask to be a reference on the [Get Into Teaching website](<%= t('get_into_teaching.url_references') %>).
