<% end %>

You will have to pass essential checks before you can start your training.

These are:
  - An enhanced disclosure and barring service (DBS) check. This is a criminal records check to make sure it is safe for you to work with children. If you are from outside of the UK and Ireland then the training provider will request a criminal records check from your home country.
  - A fitness to train to teach check. These are questions to check your ability to meet teaching standards, both physically and mentally.

The training provider will usually pay for the criminal records checks.

Contact <%= @provider_name %> if you have any questions about this.
