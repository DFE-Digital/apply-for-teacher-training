  Showing providers how your qualifications compare to UK ones with a statement of comparability makes you around 30% more likely to receive an offer.

  You can [apply for a statement of comparability ](<%= t('service_name.enic.statement_of_comparability_url') %>) from UK European Network of Information Centres (UK ENIC).

  If you want to apply again you should:
  - check that your details are still correct
  - add your UK ENIC statement of comparability to your profile
  - make sure youâ€™re happy with your personal statement
  - find a course and submit another application

  To help show your qualifications, you can [get a certified statement of your exam results](<%= t('govuk.replacement_exam_certificate_url') %>) if you did your GCSEs and A levels in the UK.

  You should also be able to request a copy of your degree certificate from the organisation where you studied in the UK.
