Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>,

<%= @course.provider.name %> has set a new application submission deadline for <%= @course.name %> for candidates who need visa sponsorship.

The deadline is <%= @deadline %>

[Submit your application for teacher training](<%= @applications_url %>) as soon as you can

## Why is there a different deadline for this course?

Applications that need visa sponsorship take longer for training providers to process. They need to do this earlier in the recruitment cycle so that candidates are able to begin courses on time in September.
