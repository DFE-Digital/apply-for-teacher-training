<% if @holiday_response_time_indicator.christmas_response_time_delay_possible? %>
  We do not count the days between Christmas day and New Years day as working days, so it could take providers longer to respond to your application at the moment.
<% end %>

<% if @holiday_response_time_indicator.easter_response_time_delay_possible? %>
  Around the Easter holidays it can take longer for training providers to respond to applications.
