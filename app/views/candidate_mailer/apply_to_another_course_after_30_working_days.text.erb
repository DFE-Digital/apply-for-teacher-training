Hello <%= @application_form.first_name %>

You submitted an application for <%= @course_name_and_code %> on <%= @application_choice.sent_to_provider_at.to_date.to_fs(:govuk_date) %>.

Because the training provider has failed to respond, we strongly recommend you apply for other courses.

^Our analysis shows that if you haven't heard back from a provider after 30 working days, you are unlikely to receive an offer.

Candidates who apply for 4 or more courses are more likely to receive an offer.

[Sign in to your account to apply for another course](<%= application_choices_link %>).

You can also contact <%= @provider_name %> to check on your application.
