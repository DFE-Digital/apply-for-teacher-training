Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>

At your request, <%= @course.provider.name %> has withdrawn your application to study <%= @course.name_and_code %>.

Get in touch if you did not ask them to do this:

<%= I18n.t('get_into_teaching.url_online_chat') %>

# You can apply again

<% if @multiple_applications %>
  Youâ€™ve now had decisions about all the courses you applied for. You did not get any offers, so you can apply again.
<% end %>
