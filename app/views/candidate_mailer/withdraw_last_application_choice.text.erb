Hello <%= @application_form.first_name %>

You’ve withdrawn your <%= 'application'.pluralize(@withdrawn_course_names.size) %> for <%= @withdrawn_course_names.to_sentence %>.

<%= render 'still_interested_content' %>

Since you withdrew your application, we’ve contacted these people to say they do not need to give a reference:

<% @application_form.application_references.feedback_requested.each do |reference| %>
  -<%= reference.name %>
<% end %>

You can send another request for a reference from them if you apply again.
