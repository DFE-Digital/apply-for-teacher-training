Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>,

#You’ve accepted <%= @provider_name %>’s offer to study <%= @course_name_and_code %>

The course will start on <%= @start_date %>.

<%= @provider_name %> will let you know if they need further information before you can start training.

#What to do if you’re unable to start training in <%= @start_date %>

Some providers allow you to defer your offer. This means that you could start your course a year later.

Every provider is different, so it may or may not be possible to do this. Find out by contacting <%= @provider_name %>.

Asking if it’s possible to defer will not affect your existing offer.
