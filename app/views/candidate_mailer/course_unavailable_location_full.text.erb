Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>,

# There are no more places at your location

There are no more places at <%= @application_choice.course_option.site.name %> for <%= @application_choice.course_option.course.name_and_code %> at <%= @application_choice.course_option.course.provider.name %>.

The places filled up while we were waiting for your references, so the provider has not got your application.

# Decide what you want to do and let us know as soon as possible

Email us at [becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk](mailto:becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk) to let us know what you want to do.

You can:

- choose a different course: https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk
- choose a different option for this course: https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk
- remove the course from your application
- keep the course on your application

If you do nothing, we’ll send your application to the provider when your references come in. There’s no guarantee they’ll consider it.
