Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>,

# Application submitted

You have successfully submitted an application for:

<% @application_form.application_choices.each do |application_choice| %>
* <%= application_choice.provider.name %> - <%= application_choice.course.name %> (<%= application_choice.course.code %>)
<% end %>

Your application reference is <%= @application_form.support_reference %>.

You can track the progress of your <%= 'application'.pluralize(@application_form.application_choices.count) %> here:

<%= candidate_interface_application_form_url %>

# Making changes to your application

You have 5 working days to edit your application or change your choice of provider, course or training location.

To make changes, [sign back in to your account](<%= candidate_interface_sign_in_url %>).

You can sign back in to change your name or contact details at any point up until enrolment. We’ll pass this information on to the training <%= 'provider'.pluralize(@application_form.application_choices.count) %>.

# Withdrawing your application

You can withdraw your application to <%= 'course'.pluralize(@application_form.application_choices.count) %> at any point, even after you've accepted an offer. [Sign in to your account](<%= candidate_interface_sign_in_url %>) and click ‘withdraw’ next to the <%= 'course'.pluralize(@application_form.application_choices.count) %> you want to withdraw. We'll let your training <%= 'provider'.pluralize(@application_form.application_choices.count) %> know.

# References

The <%= t('service_name.apply') %> service will contact your referees to ask them for references.

Your referees will be given a short questionnaire about you and a free text box to describe you in their own words. They will not be given access to your completed application form.

We will send a reminder email to your referees after 5 days. If we haven’t heard back from them after 10 days, or they refuse to give a reference, we’ll get back in touch with you to ask for a replacement.

# Interview

Most training providers don’t reach a decision about your interview until they’ve seen references.

# Application decision

If a training provider decides to progress your application, they will communicate with you directly to organise an interview date and give you all the information you need.

Your training provider will aim to make a decision on whether to make an offer within 40 working days of receiving your application.
