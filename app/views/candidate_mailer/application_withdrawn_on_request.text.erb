Hello <%= @application_form.first_name %>,
<%= @provider_name %> has withdrawn your application for <%= @course_name_and_code %>.

This may be because:

- you asked them to
- you have not responded to their attempts to contact you
- you have not met the conditions of any offer they have made you

If you do not feel your application should have been withdrawn, and you would like to continue the application process, you should contact them directly to discuss whether this is possible.

<%= render 'still_interested_content' %>
