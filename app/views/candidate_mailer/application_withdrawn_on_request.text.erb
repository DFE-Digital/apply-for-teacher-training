Hello <%= @application_form.first_name %>,

You’ve withdrawn your application for <%= @course_name_and_code %> at <%= @provider_name %>.

If now’s the right time for you, you can still apply for teacher training again this year.

All you need to do is:

  - check that your details are still correct
  - make sure you're happy with your personal statement
  - find a course and submit another application

[Sign in to apply again](<%= candidate_magic_link(@application_form.candidate) %>)

Since you withdrew your application, we’ve contacted these people to say they do not need to give a reference:

<% @application_form.application_references.each do |reference| %>
  -<%= reference.name %>
<% end %>

You can send another request for a reference from them if you apply again.
