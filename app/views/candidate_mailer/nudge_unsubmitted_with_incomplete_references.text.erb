Hello <%= @application_form.first_name %>

You have not completed the references section of your teacher training application yet.

You need to give details of 2 people who can give you a reference. They’ll only be contacted if you accept an offer on a course.

[Sign into your account to complete the references section](<%= candidate_magic_link(@application_form.candidate) %>).

# Who to choose to give you a reference

You could choose someone like a manager, a university tutor or a client.

[Find out more about what references you should add](<%= email_link_with_utm_params t('get_into_teaching.url_references'), 'nudge_unsubmitted_no_references', @application_form.phase %>).

In their reference, they will be asked to:

- confirm how they know you and how long they’ve known you for
- say if they know any reason why you should not work with children
- give factual information which can be used to check your application
