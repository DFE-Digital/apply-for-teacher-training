# How you sign in to Apply for teacher training has changed

You need to sign in using GOV.UK One Login. You can create a GOV.UK One Login if you do not already have one.

You should use the same email address to create your GOV.UK One Login that you used to sign in to Apply for teacher training before this change. This is so you keep the existing information in your account.

If you use a different email address you’ll be able to transfer your account details after you sign in.

# What is GOV.UK One Login?

GOV.UK One Login allows you to sign in to some government services using the same email address and password.

In the future you’ll be able to use your GOV.UK One Login to access all services on GOV.UK.
