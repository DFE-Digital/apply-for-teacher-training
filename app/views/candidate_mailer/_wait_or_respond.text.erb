You can wait to hear back about your other application(s) before accepting or declining any offers.

When the last decision is in, you’ll have 10 working days to respond.

You should not feel pressured to respond sooner than this.

However, if you are ready to respond to your existing offer you can do so through your account:

<%= candidate_magic_link(@application_form.candidate) %>
