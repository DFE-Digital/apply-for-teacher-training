Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>

# Who to choose as a referee

A referee could be someone like a manager, a university tutor or a client.

In their reference, your referee will be asked to talk about your:

  - communication skills
  - reliability and professionalism
  - transferable skills
  - ability to work with children
  - academic skills

So choose referees who could comment on as many of these as possible.
