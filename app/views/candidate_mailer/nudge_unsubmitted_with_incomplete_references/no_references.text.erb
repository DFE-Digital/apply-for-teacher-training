Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>

You have not yet completed the references section of your teacher training application.

You need to give details of 2 people who can give you a reference. They’ll only be contacted if you accept an offer on a course.

[Sign in to your account to start requesting references](<%= candidate_magic_link(@application_form.candidate) %>).

# Who to choose to give you a reference

A referee could be someone like a manager, a university tutor or a client.

In their reference, they will be asked to:

  - confirm how they know you and how long they’ve known you for
  - say if they know any reason why you should not work with children
  - give information which can be used to check your application

# Get help

A teacher training adviser can give advice on references:

[Get a teacher training adviser](<%= email_link_with_utm_params t('get_into_teaching.url_get_an_adviser_start'), 'nudge_unsubmitted_no_references', @application_form.phase %>)

Alternatively, call 0800 389 2500 or [chat online](<%= email_link_with_utm_params t('get_into_teaching.url_online_chat'), 'nudge_unsubmitted_no_references', @application_form.phase %>)

Monday to Friday, 8:30am to 5:30pm (except public holidays).
