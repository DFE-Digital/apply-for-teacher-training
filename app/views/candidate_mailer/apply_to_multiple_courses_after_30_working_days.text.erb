Hello <%= @application_form.first_name %>

You submitted the following applications on <%= @submitted_at %>:

<% @applications.each do |application| %>
  * <%= application[:course_name_and_code] %> at <%= application[:provider_name] %>
<% end %>

Because the training provider has failed to respond, we strongly recommend you apply for other courses.

^Our analysis shows that if you haven't heard back from a provider after 30 working days, you are unlikely to receive an offer.

Candidates who apply for 4 or more courses are more likely to receive an offer.
