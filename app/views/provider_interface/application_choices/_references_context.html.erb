    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Choosing referees</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">Referees should not be family members, partners or friends.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you’re struggling to find a suitable referee, contact your provider to discuss this.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Types of referee you can add:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Academic (for example, your university tutor or supervisor – choose an academic referee if you graduated in the last 5 years or you have a predicted grade for your degree)</li>
      <li>Professional (for example, your current line manager or a previous employer –&nbsp;if you’re self-employed, you could use a client or supplier)</li>
      <li>School-based (for example, a teacher at a school where you’ve volunteered or gained experience)</li>
      <li>Character (choose a responsible person who can confirm you’re suitable for teaching – for example, a sports coach –&nbsp;and remember that training providers will only accept character references if there’s also an academic or professional reference)</li>
    </ul>
