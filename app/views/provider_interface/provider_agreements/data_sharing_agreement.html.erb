      Introduction
    </h2>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-1-1">Background</h3>
    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">What is Apply for teacher training?</h4>
    <p class="govuk-body">Apply for teacher training is a new service designed by the Department for Education (DfE).</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">It will replace UCAS Teacher Training as the new route into initial teacher training.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Apply for teacher training and the data processing activities described in this document operate under the Secretary of State for Education’s ministerial common law powers.</p>

    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Why is DfE developing this service?</h4>
    <p class="govuk-body">DfE research showed that teacher training candidates and training providers find the current application and selection process difficult.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">DfE is trying to reduce the number of people dropping out of applying for teacher training by building a new application process.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Apply for teacher training will eventually share data with approximately 2,000 teacher training providers.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">DfE is trialling the service with selected teacher training providers. The trial will help DfE improve the service and inform government policy relating to teacher retention and recruitment.</p>

    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Why do we need this data sharing agreement?</h4>
    <p class="govuk-body">To run this service, DfE and teacher training providers need to share personal data. This includes sharing the data of:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>teacher training applicants</li>
      <li>staff processing applications (within DfE/within the teacher training organisation)</li>
      <li>candidates’ referees</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">This data sharing agreement sets out DfE’s and the provider’s responsibilities when looking after this personal data.</p>

      What personal data DfE and the provider process/share and why
    </h2>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-2-1">What data DfE and the provider will process/share</h3>
    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Candidates</h4>
    <p class="govuk-body">DfE and the provider will process and share some information about candidates including their:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>name</li>
      <li>address</li>
      <li>date of birth</li>
      <li>phone number</li>
      <li>email address</li>
      <li>any other personal/special category data that they choose to include in their application form (such as whether they’re disabled)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">DfE will also get information from the provider about candidates, such as:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>whether candidates were successful in their application (as well as the reasons why/why not)</li>
      <li>whether candidates met their conditions (including passing an enhanced DBS check)</li>
      <li>whether candidates enrolled</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Referees</h4>
    <p class="govuk-body">DfE and the provider will process and share some information about referees so that references can be processed. This includes their:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>name</li>
      <li>email address</li>
      <li>relationship to the candidate</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Staff</h4>
    <p class="govuk-body">DfE and the provider may also share the names and contact details of relevant staff within DfE/within the teacher training organisation so that applications can be processed.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">It is the provider’s responsibility to communicate this to relevant staff within their organisation.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-2-2">What the provider can use personal data for</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">The provider can use data to process teacher training applications in the ways outlined by this data sharing agreement.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Processing teacher training applications for the provider means:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>getting in touch with a candidate about their application/the information they submitted - for example, to ask if a candidate needs reasonable adjustments to attend an interview</li>
      <li>getting in touch with referees/candidates/relevant DfE staff if there has been a data security issue</li>
      <li>making decisions on applications</li>
      <li>getting statistics for internal use</li>
      <li>contacting relevant staff at DfE if necessary to process an application</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-2-3">What DfE can use personal data for</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">DfE can use data to process teacher training applications, build a better teacher training application process and get insight to inform government policy.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">This includes (but may not be limited to):</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>processing funding/bursary payments</li>
      <li>analysing teacher training applications</li>
      <li>analysing feedback from candidates and providers</li>
      <li>getting in touch with candidates regarding their application</li>
      <li>getting in touch with provider staff, candidates or referees if there has been a data security issue</li>
      <li>getting in touch with relevant staff within the teacher training organisation, if necessary, to process an application</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">DfE will also share some of the data it collects through Apply for teacher training with UCAS. This is so that DfE can:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>ensure candidates are using the two services according to DfE/UCAS policies, and contact candidates if they accept offers on both services</li>
      <li>allow DfE/UCAS to see how many people are applying for teacher training across UCAS and Apply for teacher training, in order to carry out statistical analysis</li>

      Data handling
    </h2>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-4-1">Process and systems used for sharing data</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">DfE and the provider are joint data controllers for the data collected through Apply for teacher training.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">DfE gives the provider access to the data through a digital service that allows providers to sign in securely.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Later on in the trial of the service, DfE will give relevant providers access to data through API systems which integrate with providers’ student record systems.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">DfE uses Zendesk, a customer relationship management system, to handle queries from providers. Zendesk uses various safeguards to look after data.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">DfE may also use G Suite to collect and share information, such as references, with the provider.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">DfE and the provider may also share some data through other channels, such as by phone or email.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Refer to section on ‘Third party disclosure’ for more information on how DfE shares data.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-4-2">Accuracy of the shared data</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">DfE undertakes to ensure that the data given to the provider accurately reflects the information given to DfE, though the format may be different.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-4-3">Assurance of compliance</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">DfE’s Personal Information Charter explains the standards expected of DfE when holding personal information.</p>

    </ul>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-4-4">Third party disclosure</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">Within DfE, access to data will be restricted to teams that need it for processing applications, building a better teacher training application and getting insight to inform government policy.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">DfE uses some third-party data processors, including Google Analytics, G Suite, Zendesk and Microsoft Azure.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Providers must follow guidance from the Information Commissioner’s Office on appointing and using appropriate data processors.</p>
