Dear <%= @reference.name %>

We contacted you 28 days ago to request a reference for <%= candidate_name %>.

They cannot progress with the offer they accepted from <%= @provider_name %> for a place on a teacher training course without your reference.

Use this link to give the reference or to say you cannot give one:

<%= referee_interface_url(token: @unhashed_token) %>

If you say you cannot give a reference, Rachael Harvey will be able to ask someone else. You will receive no further emails.
