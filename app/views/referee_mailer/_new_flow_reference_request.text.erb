Dear <%= @reference.name %>

<%= @candidate_name %> has accepted an offer from <%= @provider_name %> for a place on a teacher training course.

They’ve said that you can give them a reference. Their place on the course can only be confirmed after <%= @provider_name %> has received their references.

If you give a reference for <%= @candidate_name %> you’ll need to:

-confirm how you know them and how long you’ve known them for
-whether you have any concerns about them working with children
-give information which can be used to check their application, for example about <%= t("referee_mailer.guidance.#{@referee_type}") %>

Use this link to give the reference as soon as you can:

<%= referee_interface_url(token: @unhashed_token) %>

You can also use the link to say that you cannot give a reference, so that <%= @candidate_name %> knows to ask someone else.

Your reference will not be sent to <%= @candidate_name %>.
