Dear <%= @reference.name %>

<%= @candidate_name %> has accepted an offer from <%= @provider_name %> for a place on a teacher training course.

They’ve said that you can give them a reference.

You will need to:

-say whether you have any concerns about them working with children
-give factual information which can be used to check their application, for example about <%= t("referee_mailer.guidance.#{@referee_type}") %>

<% if FeatureFlag.active?(:show_reference_confidentiality_status) %>
You can choose whether <%= @candidate_first_name %> will be able to see your reference or if it should be kept confidential.
<% end %>

Use this link to give the reference or to say you cannot give one:

<%= referee_interface_url(token: @unhashed_token) %>

If you say you cannot give a reference, <%= @candidate_name %> will know they should ask someone else. You will receive no further emails.
