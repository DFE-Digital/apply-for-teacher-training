Dear <%= @reference.name %>

<%= @candidate_name %> has accepted an offer from <%= @provider_name %> for a place on a teacher training course.

Theyâ€™ve said that you can give them a reference.

You will need to:

-say whether you have any concerns about them working with children
-give factual information which can be used to check their application, for example about <%= t("referee_mailer.guidance.#{@referee_type}") %>

Use this link to give the reference or to say you cannot give one:

<%= referee_interface_url(token: @unhashed_token) %>

If you say you cannot give a reference, <%= @candidate_name %> will know they should ask someone else. You will receive no further emails.
