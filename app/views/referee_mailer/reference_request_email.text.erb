Dear <%= @reference.name %>,

<%= @candidate_name %> put us in touch with you to get a reference for their teacher training application.

# If you would like to give a reference

Use this form to give your reference:

<%= referee_interface_reference_relationship_url(token: @unhashed_token) %>

References sent by email will not be accepted.

You’ll be asked to write up to 500 words explaining whether <%= @candidate_name %> has the potential to teach. You could comment on their:

* academic skills
* communication skills
* reliability and professionalism
* ability to work with children
* transferable skills

You can start, save and return to your reference at any time.

The candidate will not be able to see what you write.

Teacher training courses can become full at any time. The sooner <%= @candidate_name %> gets a reference, the more likely it is that they’ll get a place.

# If you do not intend to give a reference

If you cannot meet the requirements outlined above or you decline to give a reference for another reason, let us know as soon as possible:
