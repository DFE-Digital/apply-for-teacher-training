Dear <%= @reference.name %>,

<%= @candidate_name %> put us in touch with you to get a reference for their teacher training application.

Please coplete the reference form as soon as you can:

<%= referee_interface_reference_relationship_url(token: @unhashed_token) %>

Teacher training courses can become full at any time. The sooner <%= @candidate_name %> gets a reference, the more likely it is that they’ll get a place.

# What’s in the reference form?

You’ll be asked to:

* confirm how you know <%= @candidate_name %>
* state whether you know of any reason why they should not work with children
* provide a reference of up to 500 words (you can talk about the candidate’s teaching potential, their reliability and professionalism, their suitability to work with children and transferable skills, for example)

You can start, save and return to your reference at any time.

The candidate will not be able to see what you write. 

# If you decline to give a reference

Let us know as soon as possible:
