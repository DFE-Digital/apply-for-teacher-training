Dear <%= @reference.name %>,

# Give a reference for <%= @candidate_name %>

<%= @candidate_name %> put us in touch with you to get a reference for their teacher training application. They applied to:

<% @application_form.application_choices.each do |application_choice| %>
* <%= application_choice.provider.name %> - <%= application_choice.course.name %>
<% end %>

Please use the link below to give a complete reference as soon as possible.

<%= @reference_link %>

If we don’t hear from you within 5 working days we’ll send you a reminder.

If you won’t give <%= @candidate_name %> a reference, please let us know as soon as possible by emailing: [becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk](mailto:becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk)

# Your data

We’ll only use your data to process the candidate’s application, unless you agree to be contacted by us about your experience of giving a reference. We’ll ask about this before you submit any information.
