Dear <%= @reference.name %>,

# Please give a reference for <%= @candidate_name %>

<%= @candidate_name %> put us in touch with you to get a reference for their teacher training application.

Give a reference as soon as possible by filling in this short form (it does not take long):

<%= referee_interface_reference_relationship_url(token: @unhashed_token) %>

Teacher training courses can become full at any time. The sooner <%= @candidate_name %> gets a reference, the more likely it is that they’ll get a place.

Let us know as soon as possible if you will not give a reference:

<%= referee_interface_refuse_feedback_url(token: @unhashed_token) %>

# Your data

We’ll only use your data to process the candidate’s application, unless you agree to be contacted by us about your experience of giving a reference. We’ll ask about this before you submit any information.
