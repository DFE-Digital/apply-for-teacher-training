# Privacy notice

<%= @candidate_name %> put us in touch with you so that you can provide a reference for them.

The Department for Education and the teacher training provider(s) the candidate has applied to have a ‘legitimate interest’ under data protection legislation to hold your data for the period needed to process the candidate’s application.
