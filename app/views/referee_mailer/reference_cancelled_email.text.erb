Dear <%= @name %>

<%= @candidate_name %> had asked for a reference for their teacher training application.

It looks like they do not need a reference anymore.

This might be because they got a reference from someone else or decided not to apply.

You do not need to do anything, but you can contact the candidate if you want to find out more.
