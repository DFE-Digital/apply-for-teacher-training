Dear <%= @name %>

<%= @candidate_name %> had previously asked for a reference from you for their teacher training application.

It looks like they do not need a reference anymore.

You do not need to do anything.

If youâ€™re in touch with the candidate they may be able to explain why they no longer need a reference.
