      This report contains data collected during the <%= @presenter.current_cycle_name %> recruitment cycle for applications in the academic year starting in <%= @presenter.academic_year_start_month %>. Statistics covering the <%= @presenter.previous_cycle_name %>, for courses starting in the <%= @presenter.previous_academic_year_name %>, are also included to allow for comparison.

      <p class="govuk-body">New definitions and methodology have been introduced for the 2024 to 2025 academic year
        because candidates can now submit applications to courses individually up to a maximum
        of <%= ApplicationForm::MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_COURSE_CHOICES %> open applications at a time. Previously, candidates
        submitted one application form with up to <%= ApplicationForm::MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_COURSE_CHOICES %> course
        choices at the same time. All <%= ApplicationForm::MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_COURSE_CHOICES %> course choices had to
        receive a decision before the candidate could submit another application form in the same recruitment cycle.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Improvements have also been made for clarity. Statistics published for cycles before 2024 use different definitions and methodology, so they cannot be compared with the
        statistics below.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">All figures in this table are counts of candidates. A candidate is a person who has submitted at least one application to an initial teacher training (ITT) course in England.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Candidates can apply for different courses. On later dates they may then apply for further courses. Any of their applications may change status throughout their lifecycle. This means that over time, some statistics may go up or down.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">For example, if a candidateâ€™s initial <%= ApplicationForm::MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_COURSE_CHOICES %> applications had been rejected, they may have submitted a fifth application. Before this date, they would have been included in the count of candidates with rejected applications. After this date, they would not be included in this count. If that fifth application were also rejected, they would then be included in the count of rejected applications again. </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The data is collected throughout the recruitment cycle which runs a year before the academic year that the applicants will start training in. The data is from the <%= @presenter.current_cycle_name %> recruitment cycle which covers application for courses starting in the <%= @presenter.academic_year_name %> academic year.

      Each recruitment cycle does not start on the same date each calendar year. The figures for 'last cycle' include data up to and including the date which was the same number of days from the first day of the previous cycle as the publication date is from the first day of this cycle. This means days in last cycle will not be the same calendar date as days in this cycle. For example, day one of last cycle was on <%= @presenter.previous_timetable.find_opens_at.to_fs(:govuk_date) %>, but day one of this cycle was <%= @presenter.report_timetable.find_opens_at.to_fs(:govuk_date) %>.
