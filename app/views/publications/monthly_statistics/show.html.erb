    <p class="govuk-body">These statistics cover applications for courses in England starting in the <%= @presenter.next_cycle_name %> academic year.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Applications for courses starting in the <%= @presenter.next_cycle_name %> academic year are submitted
    in the <%= @presenter.current_cycle_verbose_name %> recruitment cycle (ITT<%= @presenter.current_year %>) or deferred from the previous cycle for a <%= @presenter.next_cycle_name %> course start date.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Teacher training applications made directly to providers or Teach First are not included. Undergraduate teacher training is also not included.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">These statistics collect data from <%= @presenter.current_reporting_period %>
      (ITT<%= @presenter.current_year %>) and include deferred applications from the <%= @presenter.previous_cycle_verbose_name %> recruitment cycle (ITT<%= @presenter.previous_year %>).</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="by-candidate-status">2. Candidate status</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">When applying for the first time in a recruitment cycle, candidates can make up to 3 applications
      at the same time.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">The “first application” column in the first table below counts only the status of a candidate’s most
       “advanced” application, if they had more than one application in progress at the same time.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">So if a candidate is recruited to one course but rejected from another, only their recruited
       application is counted.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">“Advanced” is defined by the following order for the purpose of this data:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>recruited (most “advanced”)</li>
      <li>offer accepted by the candidate, but they still need to meet the conditions of the offer</li>
      <li>offer made by provider, but the candidate has not responded yet</li>
      <li>awaiting provider decisions</li>
      <li>offer declined by candidate</li>
      <li>application withdrawn by candidate</li>
      <li>application rejected by provider (least “advanced”)</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">If a candidate’s first set of applications do not lead to a place, the candidate can “apply again”,
    to other courses, one application at a time, as many times as they like.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">The “apply again” column of the first table below counts only the status of a candidate’s most
       recent “apply again” application. Their previous “apply again” applications are not counted anywhere in the table.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">The status of any one application changes throughout its lifecycle. Statuses are captured at
      the end of the data period.</p>
