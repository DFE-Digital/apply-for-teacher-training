# Components

## Organisation

Components in Apply are typically written for one of the interfaces of the app (candidate, provider, etc), and should be placed in the corresponding folder.

Where that isn't the case, consider placing the component in one of the following:

- utility/ - generic, reusable pieces of UI that aren't associated with any particular domain concept in Apply
- shared/ - components that are used by more than one interface, and don't belong in utility.

More detail on Apply's usage of components can be found [here](../../docs/components.md).
