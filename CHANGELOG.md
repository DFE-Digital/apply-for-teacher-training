## Candidate interface (Apply for teacher training)

### 2024-01-25 - Improve interaction with the Visa/immigration status questions

Some users have a difficult time understanding what they are being asked when presented with an 'immigration status' 
question. This change aims to address the issues found during the last round of research.

For non EEA candidates who have the right to work, we changed the free text field to a user-friendly radio button list 
so users can select the most relevant preset option.

For both EEA and non EEA candidates, we changed the 'other' text area to a text field and reduced the word count to 7.

There were several changes to support the change to request references after an offer has been accepted instead of before:

### 2022-09-07 - Candidates can begin applications for the 2022 to 2023 recruitment cycle

The [flow for adding a degree was changed](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/apply-for-teacher-training/updating-degree-entry-flow/) (for new applications only), so that the order of questions was different, and the data would be more structured.

For the 2021 to 2022 recruitment cycle, applications could no longer be submitted through UCAS and only through Apply. We made some changes to the services:

* the [‘choose a course first’ page was removed](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/apply-for-teacher-training/updating-the-choose-your-courses-flow-for-the-new-cycle/) as there is no longer any need for candidates to check if a course uses Apply or UCAS before continuing
* the [personal details section was moved to the top](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/apply-for-teacher-training/moving-personal-details-to-top/) to encourage candidates to fill this out first

### 2021-05-26 - Work history section changed

We [changed the work history section](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/apply-for-teacher-training/work-history-iteration/) so the candidates are asked for a full work history instead of the past 5 years. Candidates no longer need to describe ‘skills and experience relevant for teaching’ for each job and are instead asked if the job used skills relevant to teaching, with a yes or no answer. A tick box was added if candidates are unsure of the exact start or end dates.

### 2020-10-13 - Applications open for the 2020 to 2021 recruitment cycle

For the 2022 to 2023 recruitment cycle, we made changes to the initial email and to each of the pages shown when giving a reference, as references are now only asked for after a candidate has accepted an offer.

When making an offer, some guidance is shown to describe that references are only collected once an offer has been accepted.

### 2022-04-27 - Application number introduced

The [reference number and candidate ID was replaced with an application number](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/manage-teacher-training-applications/replacing-reference-number-and-candidate-id-with-application-number/) to simplify how we use identifiers.
