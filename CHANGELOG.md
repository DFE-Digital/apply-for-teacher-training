## Candidate interface (Apply for teacher training)

### 2023-03-02 - Number of application choices increased to 4

The number of course choices that candidates can apply to at a time was increased from 3 to 4.

### 2022-11-15 – Asking candidates if rejection feedback is helpful

Candidates who receive feedback when an application is rejected are now asked whether the feedback is helpful or not.

### 2022-10-11 - Applications open for the 2022 to 2023 recruitment cycle

There were several changes to support the change to request references after an offer has been accepted instead of before:

* The Accept offer flow is updated to allow candidates to change and confirm the people who’ll be asked to give them a reference
* If a candidate accepted an offer, a new screen is shown allowing them to see the status of their references and offer conditions
* Candidates are able to request additional references, chase or cancel them after an offer has been accepted

### 2022-09-07 - Candidates can begin applications for the 2022 to 2023 recruitment cycle

* References no longer need to be requested as part of the application, and then 2 selected. Instead, details of 2 people who can give a reference are required, in a new task within the 'Safeguarding' section.

Several changes were made to the equality and diversity survey:

* The content of the introduction page was updated, to be simpler
* 'Intersex' replaced with 'Other' in sex question
* 'Roma' added as an ethnicity
* The 'Do you have a disability' quesiton was removed, and instead all candidates are shown a list of disabilities and health conditions, along with a 'None' option
* A new question was added asking if the candidate received free school meals.

### 2022-02-21 - Apply again changes

Candidates who apply again can now pick 3 courses instead of 1 to apply to.

## Referee interface

### 2022-10-11 - Reference guidance changed

For the 2022 to 2023 recruitment cycle, we made changes to the initial email and to each of the pages shown when giving a reference, as references are now only asked for after a candidate has accepted an offer. Referees are no longer asked whether the candidate has the potential to teach, but are instead asked to provide a factual reference.

## Provider interface (Manage teacher training)

### 2022-10-11 - References changes for the 2022 to 2023 recruitment cycle

Information about references was moved from the application page to a new references page. Before an offer has been accepted, only the details of the referees are shown. After an offer has been accepted, the references themselves are shown as they come in.

When making an offer, some guidance is shown to describe that references are only collected once an offer has been accepted.

### 2022-04-26 - Reasons for rejections changed

When rejecting an application, providers now see a new set of options to explain their reasons for rejecting the candidate.

## Support interface (Support for Apply)
