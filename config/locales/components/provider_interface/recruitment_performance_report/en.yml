          <p class="govuk-body">These statistics cover applications in the 2023 to 2024 recruitment cycle for courses in
          England starting in the 2024 to 2025 academic year. To allow for comparison, statistics covering the 2022 to
          2023 recruitment cycle 2023 to 2024 academic year are also included.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">New definitions and methodology have been introduced for the 2023 to 2024 recruitment
          cycle to 2025 academic year because candidates can now submit applications to courses individually up to a
          maximum of 4 open applications at a time. Previously, candidates submitted one application form with up to
          4 course choices at the same time. All 4 course choices had to receive a decision before the candidate could
          submit another application form in the same recruitment cycle.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Improvements have also been made for clarity.</p>
        subsection_heading_two: Data which is not included in these reports

        applications_made_directly_to_providers: teacher training applications made directly to providers
        undergraduate_except_tda: undergraduate teacher training (except teacher degree apprenticeship (TDA) courses)
        further_education_applications: applications to train to teach in Further Education
        understanding_the_figures_in_the_table_heading: Understanding the figures in the tables
        understanding_the_figures_explanation_html: >
          <p class="govuk-body">All figures in this table are counts of candidates. A candidate is a person who has
          submitted at least one application to an initial teacher training (ITT) course in England.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Because candidates can apply for multiple courses throughout the recruitment cycle,
          their application statuses change over time. This means that over time, some numbers in this report can go
          up or down.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">For example, if a candidate’s first application to a provider is rejected, they might
          submit a second application.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">After their first application is rejected, but before they submit their second
          application, they are included in the count of candidates with rejected applications.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body"> If their second application is also rejected, they would be included in the count of
          rejected applications again.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Candidates can submit applications for more than one subject. These candidates are
          counted under all subjects that they have applied to. This means that the ‘All subjects’ row does not equal
          the total of the rows above it.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Subjects with no applications are not included in the tables. This means that some
          subjects may appear in some tables and not others.</p>
        data_timeframes_heading: Data timeframes
        data_timeframes_explanation_html:
          <p class="govuk-body">The recruitment cycle does not start on the same date each year. Where a table
          compares data from last cycle to this cycle, the data will not be for the same dates, but it will be for the
          same number of days.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">The time period that is used for comparison is the same number of days from the start
          of the last cycle, as the report date is from the start of this cycle.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">These statistics are updated up to and including the day before they are published.
          The report is published weekly on a Monday.</p>
