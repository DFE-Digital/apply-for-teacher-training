  application_states:
    unsubmitted:
      name: Not submitted yet
      description: |
        When a candidate has filled in their email address, they’ve started
        an application. Until they submit their application, it is in the
        unsubmitted state. The providers don’t see the application at this
        stage.

    awaiting_references:
      name: Awaiting references
      description: |
        The candidate submits their application choices with a list of referees. Until 2 references have been received all applications remain in the Awaiting references state.
        The providers don’t see the application at this stage.

    application_complete:
      name: Waiting to be sent
      description: |
        The references have come back and have been added to the application.
        Candidates are allowed a cooling-off period of 5 days to modify their application before it’s sent to providers.
        They can't modify the references.

    awaiting_provider_decision:
      name: Awaiting provider decision
      description: |
        Providers only see the application after the references have come back
        and have been added to the application and 5 days have elapsed for
        the candidate to review and modify the application.

        When both of these prerequisites are met the application moves to the
        Awaiting provider decision state.

    offer:
      name: Offer made
      description: |
        The provider has made an offer to the candidate. The candidate has to accept
        or reject the offer, which sets the application status to 'Pending
        conditions'.

        We assume that all offers have some conditions, even if there
        are no academic conditions.

    recruited:
      name: Recruited
      description: |
        When the provider confirms that the offer conditions have been met, the application is marked 'recruited'.

    enrolled:
      name: Candidate enrolled
      description: |
        Once the candidate has completed the enrolment process, the provider confirms
        their enrolment onto the training programme. Since this status would be used
        to claim bursaries/grants from DfE, the provider may delay enrolling the trainee
        until a few weeks after the start of the training, since trainees can still
        not show up on the first day or drop out within the first couple of weeks.
        This reduces the risk that DfE over-pays that provider for training they didn’t
        deliver and has to reconcile later on.

        The candidate’s HESA equality monitoring information is made available to the provider.

    pending_conditions:
      name: Pending conditions
      description: Provider is waiting for the candidate to prove that they’ve met the conditions.

    rejected:
      name: Rejected

    withdrawn:
