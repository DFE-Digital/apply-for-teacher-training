    whats_new_in_2024_paragraph_one: >
      These statistics cover applications in the 2023 to 2024 recruitment cycle for courses in England starting in the
      2024 to 2025 academic year. To allow for comparison, statistics covering the 2022 to 2023 recruitment cycle 2023
      to 2024 academic year are also included.
    whats_new_in_2024_paragraph_two: >
      New definitions and methodology have been introduced for the 2023 to 2024 recruitment cycle  to 2025 academic year
      because candidates can now submit applications to courses individually up to a maximum of 4 open applications at
      a time. Previously, candidates submitted one application form with up to 4 course choices at the same time. All 4
      course choices had to receive a decision before the candidate could submit another application form in the same
      recruitment cycle.
    whats_new_in_2024_paragraph_three: >
      Improvements have also been made for clarity.
    subsection_heading_two: Data which is excluded from these reports
    subsection_two_paragraph_one: "The following types of applications are not included in these reports:"
    subsection_two_list_item_one: teacher training applications made directly to providers
    subsection_two_list_item_two: undergraduate teacher training
    subsection_two_list_item_three: applications to train to teach in Further Education
    subsection_heading_three: Understanding the figures in the tables
    subsection_three_paragraph_one: >
      All figures in this table are counts of candidates. A candidate is a person who has submitted at least one
      application to an initial teacher training (ITT) course in England.
    subsection_three_paragraph_two: >
      Candidates can apply for different courses. On later dates they may then apply for further courses. Any of their
      applications may change status throughout their lifecycle. This means that over time, some statistics may go up
      or down.
    subsection_three_paragraph_three: >
      For example, if a candidate’s initial application to a provider had been rejected, they may have submitted a
      second application. Before this date, they would have been included in the count of candidates with rejected
      applications. After this date, they would not be included in this count. If that second application were also
      rejected, they would then be included in the count of rejected applications again.
    subsection_three_paragraph_four: >
      Candidates may submit applications for more than one subject. These candidates are counted under all subjects
      that apply. This means that the ‘All subjects’ row does not equal the total of the preceding rows.
    subsection_three_paragraph_five: >
      Subjects where no candidates have been counted are omitted from the tables. This means that some subjects may
      appear in some tables and not others.
    subsection_heading_four: Data timeframes
    subsection_four_paragraph_one: >
      Each recruitment cycle does not start on the same date each calendar year. The figures for 'last cycle' include
      data up to and including the date which was the same number of days from the first day of the previous cycle as
      the publication date is from the first day of the current cycle.
    subsection_four_paragraph_two: >
      This means days in last cycle will not be the same calendar date as days in this cycle. For example, day one of
      last cycle was on %{last_cycle_start_date}, but day one of the current cycle was %{this_cycle_start_date}.
    subsection_four_paragraph_three: >
      These statistics collect data up to and including the day before they were published. The report is published
      weekly on a Monday.
