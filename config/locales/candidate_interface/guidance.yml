        heading: The application process for courses starting in September %{this_cycle}
        you_can_start_applying: For courses starting in September %{this_cycle}, you can start applying a year before they start in October %{last_cycle}.
        duration: Most teacher training courses are one year and start in September when the academic year in England starts. Part time courses are usually 2 years.
        find_courses_html: "Start %{link} you might want to apply to."
        start_applying: |
          Start applying to courses. You can apply to %{max_courses} courses, they can fill up quickly so you should apply as soon as you can.

          Providers can close courses to new applications when they fill up.

          You can withdraw an application at any time and apply to a different course if you want to.

          If training providers do not respond to an application within 30 working days, you will be able to apply to another course while you wait for a response. We will tell you if the provider has not responded in time. Around the Easter and Christmas breaks, providers can take longer to respond to applications.

          You will get an email if you receive an offer from a training provider.
        if_unsuccessful_html: If your applications are unsuccessful you can %{link} with other training providers. They can search a list of available candidates and invite you to apply if you meet their criteria.
        last_day_to_submit: |
          The last day that you can submit most applications. Some providers will close their courses before this date.

          Courses which sponsor visas can close earlier so that there is time to process the paperwork needed for visa sponsored course places.
        last_day_to_decide: The last day for training providers to make a decision on all applications for courses starting in September %{this_cycle}.
