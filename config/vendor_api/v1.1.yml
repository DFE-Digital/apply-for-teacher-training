      summary: Get many applications
      description: |
        This endpoint can be used to retrieve applications for the authenticating
        provider. Applications are returned with the most recently updated ones first.

        Use the `since` parameter to limit the number of results. This is intended
        to make it possible to check for new or updated applications regularly.

        Retrieving applications in "pages" allows you to handle large volumes of applications in smaller, manageable batches.
        Using pagination is strongly recommended to improve the performance and stability of your client.

        Use the `page` parameter to retrieve the indicated page of results. The first call should ask for page 1.
        Use the links object in the response to navigate subsequent paginated results.

        Use the `per_page` parameter to specify how many applications to return per page. The default and maximum value is 50.

        To utilise pagination both `page` and `per_page` parameters must be specified.
      parameters:
      - name: since
        description: Include only applications changed or created on or since a date
          and time. Times should be in ISO 8601 format.
