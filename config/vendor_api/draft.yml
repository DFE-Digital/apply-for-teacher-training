        This endpoint can be used to retrieve applications for the authenticating
        provider. Applications are returned with the most recently updated ones first.

        Use the `since` parameter to limit the number of results. This is intended
        to make it possible to check for new or updated applications regularly.
      parameters:
      - name: since
        description: Include only applications changed or created on or since a date
          and time. Times should be in ISO 8601 format.
